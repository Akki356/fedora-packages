<tt>The Fedora Unity Project is proud to announce the release of new ISO 
</tt><tt>Re-Spins of Fedora 9.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>These Re-Spin ISOs are based on the officially released Fedora 8 
</tt><tt>installation media and include all updates released as of October 4th, 2008.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The ISO images are available for i386, x86_64 architectures via Jigdo 
</tt><tt>and Torrent starting Tuesday October 7th, 2008.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

     DVD Media Only

</pre><tt>Due to known problems in comps,  this is a DVD Only Re-spin. The CD 
</tt><tt>version would have required all 6 to 7 discs to install.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">


     Full Installation Problems if Language Support Groups Selected

</pre><tt>Selecting some language groups will cause file conflict errors, such as 
</tt><tt>reported and explained in #465715

-- Fedora 10 (Cambridge) Beta --

</pre><tt>Jesse Keating announced[1] the release of Fedora 10 Beta. &quot;Just on the 
</tt><tt>heels of the Fedora Project's fifth anniversary, the Beta of Fedora 
</tt><tt>Linux version 10 (code-named Cambridge) is now available.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Among the new, fun, and interesting features:

    * New NetworkManager with connection sharing
    * Improved printer handling
    * Remote virtualization and easier virt storage
    * Sectool, an auditing and security testing framework
    * RPM 4.6, the first big RPM change in several years

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Additionally, Jesse reported[2] &quot;there was a small problem during image 
</tt><tt>creation that led to the x86_64 Live KDE actually being the content for 
</tt><tt>the x86_64 Live XFCE. I have recreated these images and updated the 
</tt><tt>master mirror and the torrent server.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

For full disclosure, here are the SHA1SUMs of each:

</pre><tt>6f32b75c09838a407371aec211e1951d357baf03 *F10-Beta-x86_64-Live-KDE.iso

-- Fedora Board IRC Meeting --

</pre><tt>Paul Frields reminded[3] everyone that &quot;the Board is holding its monthly 
</tt><tt>public meeting on Tuesday, 7 October 2008, at 1800 UTC on IRC Freenode.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

The public is invited to do the following:

</pre><tt>    * Join #fedora-board-meeting to see the Board's conversation. This 
</tt><tt>channel is read-only for non-Board members.
</tt><tt>    * Join #fedora-board-public to discuss topics and post questions. 
</tt><tt>This channel is read/write for everyone.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The moderator will direct questions from the #fedora-board-public 
</tt><tt>channel to the Board members at #fedora-board-meeting. This should limit 
</tt><tt>confusion and ensure our logs are useful to everyone.

-- PATH:/sbin Tab Confusion --

</pre><tt>Some time ago (2008-04-23) it was proposed[1] by Tom Callaway to append 
</tt><tt>/sbin\ and /usr/sbin to the path of non-root users. The rationale was to 
</tt><tt>make it easier for non-root users to use tools which are traditionally 
</tt><tt>perceived as &quot;administration&quot; tools, for example ifconfig, parted and 
</tt><tt>fdisk. A good overview of the problem was posted[2] by Behdad Esfahbod . 
</tt><tt>An excellent compendium of objections to the proposal posted[3] by 
</tt><tt>Enrico Scholz encapsulates most of the problems perceived at the time. 
</tt><tt>Several prolonged discussions on the topic mostly centered[4] around 
</tt><tt>alternate strategies which included moving binaries from /sbin to /bin, 
</tt><tt>symlinking from one to the other directory, or setting up[5] sudo by 
</tt><tt>default.

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The case for moving many of the binaries was made[6] strongly by David 
</tt><tt>Cantrell and arch-skeptic Ralf Corsepius voiced[7] a general objection 
</tt><tt>that &quot;[...] this discussion is as old as */sbin exists [... and I] 
</tt><tt>consider both proposals to be populist propaganda.&quot; After much thrashing 
</tt><tt>out of the issue the proposal was coalesced[8] in the Feature named 
</tt><tt>&quot;/sbin Sanity&quot; and /usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin were appended to the 
</tt><tt>PATH of normal users of Fedora 10. A related change suggested was to 
</tt><tt>allow firstboot to configure sudo to grant the first created user all 
</tt><tt>privileges but this feature is not present in Fedora 10 Beta.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>With the release of Fedora 10 Beta some of the predicted daily 
</tt><tt>inconveniences of the change have been realized[9]. Matt Miller (who had 
</tt><tt>been consistently opposed to the change) reported that command-line 
</tt><tt>completion was cluttered with multiple unwanted choices: &quot;We've just 
</tt><tt>made the command line a lot less user friendly for common use in 
</tt><tt>exchange for an ugly fix to a small inconvenience.&quot; In a wryly humorous 
</tt><tt>post he noted that due to wanting /etc/profile.d to continue working he 
</tt><tt>could not simply set a static path. Stephen Smoogen joked[10] that Matt 
</tt><tt>was the &quot;[...] first systems administrator I have met in several years 
</tt><tt>who hasn't had /usr/sbin:/sbin in their default path. You sure they 
</tt><tt>didn't make you a manager and didn't tell you?&quot; and added that &quot;I think 
</tt><tt>the chance for putting it back is still there.. if someone is willing to 
</tt><tt>do the work on the hard but correct way? I think it was crickets the 
</tt><tt>last couple of times when volunteers were asked for that.&quot; Nigel Jones 
</tt><tt>was among several who asserted[11] that typing the full paths was what 
</tt><tt>they preferred and Stephen admitted[12] that he had received some 
</tt><tt>offlist ribbing and promised to mend his ways: &quot;I am removing 
</tt><tt>/sbin:/usr/sbin from my path and learning to type /usr/sbin for the 
</tt><tt>commands I have 'shortcutted' over the years. Next I will be removing 
</tt><tt>the bad habit of '/sbin/sudo bash' :)&quot;

</pre><tt>Ville Skyttä and Matt Miller volunteered[13] to take up the burden of 
</tt><tt>moving appropriate binaries out of /sbin and into /bin in order to help 
</tt><tt>revert the change.

</pre><tt>Over on @fedora-desktop Rahul Sundaram suggested a kickstart snippet 
</tt><tt>which would add the first user to the wheel group and add blanket 
</tt><tt>permissions to the wheel group in /etc/sudoers . Colin Walters 
</tt><tt>agreed[14] with the concept but wondered &quot;[a]re we too far into the F10 
</tt><tt>process for this?&quot;

-- Speeding-up Modprobe and MAKEDEV --

</pre><tt>Inspired by Arjan van de Ven's five-second Asus EeePC boot and 
</tt><tt>Mandriva's work on similar topics Jakub Jelinek posted[1] his patches to 
</tt><tt>improve the speed of modprobe and MAKEDEV. He hoped that this sharing 
</tt><tt>would result in more community experimentation. The first patch enables 
</tt><tt>depmod -a to produce compact binary files which can be searched for 
</tt><tt>aliases and dependencies more quickly than the standard text files, 
</tt><tt>which are still also produced. The patch to MAKEDEV similarly reduces 
</tt><tt>the size of the searched files, in this case config files, and improves 
</tt><tt>the efficiency of an inner loop. The times appeared to be decreased by 
</tt><tt>several orders of magnitude according to the sample figures posted by Jakub.

</pre><tt>Kyle McMartin was excited[2] and suggested that &quot;[t]he biggest win by

</tt><tt>Bill Nottingham responded[3] that MAKEDEV ought not to be run at boot at

</tt><tt>applied upstream as he noted[4] that he had sent it upstream over ten

-- Uniform Proxy Settings --

</pre><tt>The issue of constructing a uniform method of enforcing proxy settings 
</tt><tt>for applications was raised[1] by Kulbir Saini. He complained 
</tt><tt>&quot;[w]henever I try a new version of Fedora, the first problem I face is 
</tt><tt>setting the proxy. It seems for almost every application, I have to 
</tt><tt>specify proxy at a different place.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>A reply by Simon Andrews recapped[2] previous debates on the topic by 
</tt><tt>pointing out the twin problems of a lack of a common setting and the 
</tt><tt>inability of many applications to update their proxy settings on the 
</tt><tt>fly. Simon suggested that a localhost proxy could be forced on all 
</tt><tt>applications if NetworkManager were to contain hooks to re-route local 
</tt><tt>proxy requests either directly to the internet or via a secondary proxy. 
</tt><tt>He admitted &quot;this all feels a bit icky to me - but I can't think of a 
</tt><tt>nicer way of doing this which doesn't require the cooperation of the 
</tt><tt>authors of every proxy-aware application.&quot;

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Nicolas 'kwizart' Chauvet had also thought about the problem and made[3] 
</tt><tt>some changes to libproxy which he hoped would solve the problem. Dan 
</tt><tt>Winship wrote[4] a great post explaining that libproxy could adaptively 
</tt><tt>use whichever backend was appropriate for the environment in which it 
</tt><tt>was used and although it was not widely used by applications it looked 
</tt><tt>set to become an integral part of GNOME.

</tt><tt>acceptable in a monolithic desktop application?&quot; with reference to the 
</tt><tt>mainloop integration. This developed into a comparison[7] between future 
</tt><tt>scenarios in which PackageKit overrode yum downloads in a desktop

-- virt-manager Supports Multiple Serial Consoles --

</pre><tt>Cole Robinson patched[1] virt-manager to combine &quot;the serial console 
</tt><tt>window with the VM details window. Opening the serial console now 
</tt><tt>appends a tab to the details view. In addition, multiple serial consoles 
</tt><tt>are now supported, not just the primary/first defined console, though 
</tt><tt>this still only works for 'pty' devices.&quot;

-- Maintaining VM State While Restarting libvirtd Needed --

</pre><tt>Upgrades of libvirt necessitate a restart of libvirtd. Guido Günther 
</tt><tt>asked[1] if there was any progress on saving enough state to restart 
</tt><tt>libvirtd without restarting any guests. Daniel P. Berrange replied[2] 
</tt><tt>this has been solved for the LXC driver and the same approach may apply 
</tt><tt>to the QEMU driver.

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Guido pointed[3] out &quot;This would solve the problem of restarting 
</tt><tt>libvirtd. How are we going to distinguish this from daemon shutdown on 
</tt><tt>e.g. system reboot?&quot; To which, Daniel B. proposed[4] &quot;We can probably 
</tt><tt>distinguish by picking a specific signal for orderly shutdown of the 
</tt><tt>daemon + vms, vs a simple restart.&quot; Adding, &quot;Perhaps we should have an 
</tt><tt>explicit API, or a convenient virsh command to shutdown all VMs in one go.&quot;

-- Fedora Xen List --

This section contains the discussion happening on the fedora-xen list.

-- No Dom0 Support in Fedora 10 --

</pre><tt>Daniel P. Berrange laid[1] it out there. &quot;There is pretty much zero 
</tt><tt>chance that Fedora 10 will include a Xen Dom0 host. While upstream Xen 
</tt><tt>developers are making good progress on porting Dom0 to paravirt_ops, 
</tt><tt>there is simply too little time for this to be ready for Fedora 10. So 
</tt><tt>if you need to use Fedora 10 as a host, then KVM is your only viable 
</tt><tt>option at this time. If you can wait for Fedora 11 (or use RHEL-5 / 
</tt><tt>CentOS-5) then Xen may be an option for you.&quot; See also FWN 143[2].

-- Running Xen Guests Without xend --

</pre><tt>Stefan de Konink asked[1] if users could someday run xen guests without 
</tt><tt>a xend running. Gerd Hoffmann said[2] there are patches queued up which 
</tt><tt>begin to allow qemu to do this. Adding, &quot;If things work out well we 
</tt><tt>might have that in the F11 timeframe.&quot; Assuming Dom0 support in the 
</tt><tt>pv_ops based kernel is completed.

-- cgroups API and LXC Driver Support --

</pre><tt>Dan Smith posted[1] a patch set which &quot;adds basic cgroup[2] support to 
</tt><tt>the LXC driver. It consists of a small internal cgroup manipulation API, 
</tt><tt>as well as changes to the driver itself to utilize the support.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/cgroups.txt">http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/cgroups.txt</a>

</pre><tt>Dan agreed[3] to &quot;reswizzle&quot; the API after Daniel P. Berrange 
</tt><tt>commented[4], &quot;My thought on the overall design of this internal API is 
</tt><tt>that it is too low level &amp; pushing too much work to the caller.&quot; Also, 
</tt><tt>&quot;While LXC driver is the only current user, as more controllers are 
</tt><tt>added I anticipate that QEMU driver might use cgroups, eg for I/O 
</tt><tt>controls and CPU schedular controls. As such I'd expect an API to be at 
</tt><tt>a slightly higher level of abstraction, strongly typed and a single 
</tt><tt>cgroup object associated with a domain object.&quot;

</pre><tt>There was discussion of how to mount the controllers. The cgroups kernel 
</tt><tt>interace is less than ideal, because[5] &quot;...once you mount a particular 
</tt><tt>controller, you can't change the way it's mounted. So if libvirt mounted 
</tt><tt>each controller separately, then the admin couldn't have a mount with 
</tt><tt>multiple controllers active, and vica-verca.&quot;

</pre><tt>This prompted Balbir Singh to begin a new thread recommending[6] the use 
</tt><tt>of libcgroups[7] rather than an internal implementation. Adding, &quot;I 
</tt><tt>understand that in the past there has been a perception that libcgroups 
</tt><tt>might not yet be ready, because we did not have ABI stability built into 
</tt><tt>the library and the header file had old comments about things changing. 
</tt><tt>I would urge the group to look at the current implementation of

</pre><tt>Daniel Veillard pointed[8] to issues of dependency and API completeness 
</tt><tt>raised[9] in the past. &quot;In the meantime we got a relatively simple, 
</tt><tt>sufficient for now, usable right now, patch fullfilling our needs.&quot;

</tt><tt>available in Rawhide soon. The thread amicably continued on in great

-- libvirtd Multi-threaded Support in the Works --

</pre><tt>Daniel P. Berrange posted[1] &quot;I've been doing some proof of concept work 
</tt><tt>to make the libvirtd daemon multi-threaded, and this in turns mean that 
</tt><tt>the QEMU / LXC / OpenVZ drivers need to have some degree of locking on 
</tt><tt>their internal data structures.&quot; The internal APIs extensive use of 
</tt><tt>linked lists makes fine grained locking of objects very difficult, which 
</tt><tt>lead to Daniel's series of patches aimed at removing all use of linked 
</tt><tt>lists.

-- Host Device Enumeration API --

</pre><tt>In August David Lively announced[1] an intent to work on an API[2] for 
</tt><tt>host device enumeration, creation, and deletion. Daniel P. Berrange 
</tt><tt>inquired[3] as to the status of the work. The &quot;oVirt guys&quot; are keen to 
</tt><tt>have the functionality ASAP.

</pre><tt>David reported[4] progress on HAL-based and more limited DevKit-based 
</tt><tt>drivers and posted a preliminary patch. Daniel B. concurred[5] that &quot;HAL 
</tt><tt>is clearly the more portable option for a little while to come, but for 
</tt><tt>Linux at least DeviceKit will (eventually) be the preferred way to 
</tt><tt>access this kind of info.&quot; David later gave[6] up on DevKit for now.

-- SDL Display Support for QEMU Driver --

</pre><tt>Daniel P. Berrange posted[1] a patch to enable SDL displays for QEMU. 
</tt><tt>Daniel explained &quot;QEMU has two modes of providing a graphical display, 
</tt><tt>VNC and SDL. Now most of our tools just use VNC, but occasionally people 
</tt><tt>want to use SDL for some crazy reason. We already support this in Xen

-- oVirt Devel List --

This section contains the discussion happening on the ovirt-devel list.

-- oVirt Web API ala EC2 Web Services --

</pre><tt>Noel Rocher asked[1] if there was web-enabled API similar to EC2[2] 
</tt><tt>which could be used manage guest images and instances. Hugh O. Brock 
</tt><tt>explained[3] there is a REST API for scripting most oVirt operations, 
</tt><tt>soon to be accompanied by a command-line interface. However, the API is 
</tt><tt>in early stages and poorly documented.

-- QPID Modeling Framework and libvirt-qpid --

</pre><tt>Ian Main wanted to say[1] a few words about the patches to libvirt-qpid 
</tt><tt>into ovirt which &quot;provides an interface with libvirt using QMF[2] (qpid 
</tt><tt>modeling framework) which utilizes the AMQP[3] protocol. The Advanced 
</tt><tt>Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard application layer 
</tt><tt>protocol providing reliable transport of messages.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&quot;QMF provides a modeling framework layer on top of qpid (which 
</tt><tt>implements AMQP). This interface allows you to manage hosts, domains, 
</tt><tt>pools etc. as a set of objects with properties and methods.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&quot;With this patch in place, you can log into the WUI, and use qpid-tool 
</tt><tt>(a generic qpid QMF client) to view and manipulate nodes/domains/pools etc.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

QPID was added[4] to libvirt in September.

-- Booting Guest From ISO Image --

</pre><tt>Darryl L. Pierce is adding[1] support for booting a VM from an ISO 
</tt><tt>image. After adding an ISO image to the Cobbler server on the appliance 
</tt><tt>with the full NFS URL needed to mount it, &quot;If the filename ends in 
</tt><tt>'.iso' then the virtual machine will mount the file as a CDROM device 
</tt><tt>and boot it. Otherwise, it mounts it as a hard disk device.&quot; There 
</tt><tt>remains a bug which requires manual intervention to complete the boot 
</tt><tt>from CDROM.

<pre>he Board is holding its monthly public meeting on Tuesday, 7 October
2008, at 1800 UTC on IRC Freenode.  The public is invited to do the
following:

* Join #fedora-board-meeting to see the Board's conversation.  This
channel is read-only for non-Board members.
* Join #fedora-board-public to discuss topics and post questions.  This
channel is read/write for everyone.

The moderator will direct questions from the #fedora-board-public
channel to the Board members at #fedora-board-meeting.  This should limit
confusion and ensure our logs are useful to everyone.

﻿The Board has set aside one meeting of each month as a public &quot;town
hall&quot; style meeting.  We are *still* hoping to hold an audio-based
meeting at some point in the near future using some of the new resources
being developed by the Infrastructure team.  More news on this will be
forthcoming.  We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>posted by Jesse Keating &lt;jkeating redhat com&gt;</p>
<pre>There was a small problem during image creation that led to the x86_64
Live KDE actually being the content for the x86_64 Live XFCE.  I have
recreated these images and updated the master mirror and the torrent
server.

For full disclosure, here are the SHA1SUMs of each:

6f32b75c09838a407371aec211e1951d357baf03 *F10-Beta-x86_64-Live-KDE.iso
04195ea383229bdd356188e86ba8c39985118abb *F10-Beta-x86_64-Live-XFCE.iso

Note that while some of the other torrents have SHA1SUM files that may
reference the old sha1sums of these, they will not be replaced at this
time as that would reset existing down-loaders of other content and
cause undue complications.

</tt><tt>valuable thing I’ve learned watching Fedora is this: Patience. It takes 
</tt><tt>time and steady, incremental growth to build a solid community. If you’d 
</tt><tt>asked me two years into Fedora’s development whether the project would

-- Default Deactivation of Services --

</pre><tt>Christoph Höger initiated[1] this week's mammoth thread with a request 
</tt><tt>to disable four services currently activated by default: sendmail, 
</tt><tt>ip6tables, isdn and setroubleshootd. Christoph invited the list to &quot;go 
</tt><tt>on and punish me&quot; after supplying some brief reasons for the deactivations.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg02197.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg02197.html</a>
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Discussion mostly centered on the sendmail problem with suggestions 
</tt><tt>ranging from starting it asynchronously and late, as suggested[2] by 
</tt><tt>Alan Cox, to replacing it with one of the &quot;send-only&quot; MTAs such as 
</tt><tt>ssmtp. Part of the interest over this seemed to be stimulated by the 
</tt><tt>information posted[3] by Colin Walters that the &quot;[...] desktop image no 
</tt><tt>longer installs sendmail by default.&quot; This led to a need to distinguish 
</tt><tt>between the desktop LiveCD and regular installs, as was done[4] by Bill 
</tt><tt>Nottingham. Some apparent legal threats posted by Matthew Woehlke led[5] 
</tt><tt>Seth Vidal to point him to the nearest convenient exit. Ralf Ertzinger 
</tt><tt>noted[6] the deeply entrenched nature of sendmail: &quot;Unfortunately, 
</tt><tt>sendmail isn't just a program, it's an API. Calling /usr/lib/sendmail 
</tt><tt>has been the way to get mail out (wherever out is) in UNIX for, well, as 
</tt><tt>long as sendmail exists, which is quite some time.&quot;

</pre><tt>The problem of lack of local delivery with the proposed replacements was 
</tt><tt>brought up[7] by Patrice Dumas. This was seen as a stumbling block 
</tt><tt>because cron needs it and led Jesse Keating to argue[8]: &quot;[W]e shouldn't 
</tt><tt>be using local delivery for this stuff. Instead we should ask in 
</tt><tt>firstboot where you'd want the mail delivered to.&quot; Matt Miller 
</tt><tt>replied[9] with a link to a bugzilla entry in which he had proposed just 
</tt><tt>such a thing in 2004. Other aspects of the problem of disentangling 
</tt><tt>potentially important log data from the mail delivery mechanism were 
</tt><tt>touched[10] upon in other parts of the thread. Deep in the thread Arjan 
</tt><tt>van de Ven pointed[11] to aliases generation as the reason for sendmail 
</tt><tt>being slow to start up.

</pre><tt>The complaint about setroubleshootd was addressed[12] by Steve Grubb. He

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>ip6tables was defended on two fronts. On the first Daniel P. Berrange 
</tt><tt>explained[13] how accessible IPv6 was and how likely it was that all 
</tt><tt>machines on a network could automatically acquiring IPv6 addresses. 
</tt><tt>Typical of the reaction on the other front Gregory Maxwell was 
</tt><tt>startled[14] at the idea of being exposed without firewalling upon 
</tt><tt>plugging into an IPv6 enabled network. He added the statistic that 
</tt><tt>&quot;About 4% of the web browsers hitting English language Wikipedia are 
</tt><tt>IPv6 enabled. IPv6 enabled web clients may even become more numerous 
</tt><tt>than Linux desktops this year, almost certainly by next year, so be 
</tt><tt>careful what you call rare. :)&quot; Stephen John Smoogen also explained[15] 
</tt><tt>that if there were no IPv6 firewall a ping6 -I eth0 ff02::1 would enable 
</tt><tt>an attacker to &quot;walk the hosts with no firewalls.&quot; He suggested that 
</tt><tt>completely disabling IPv6 would be preferable but might affect IPsec and 
</tt><tt>related components.

</pre><tt>No one seemed particularly concerned at the idea of disabling isdn by

-- specspo and PackageKit --

</pre><tt>A quick query was posted[16] by Richard Hughes asking whether PackageKit 
</tt><tt>should dump its dependency on specspo[17]. The advantage would be a 
</tt><tt>savings of 27Mb installed size and 6.9Mb download size. Tim Lauridsen 
</tt><tt>was against a hard dependency and argued[18] that as specspo was part of 
</tt><tt>the @base group it would be installed by default on a normal desktop and 
</tt><tt>could then be used, whereas on the LiveCD its absence was desired due to 
</tt><tt>the space constraints.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>[16] 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg02026.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg02026.html</a>
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>[17] &quot;specspo&quot; is the rpm package which contains all the portable object 
</tt><tt>catalogues which provide translations for Fedora packages.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>[18] 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg02034.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg02034.html</a>
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>An interesting discussion about alternate methods to provide translated 
</tt><tt>package descriptions ensued when Seth Vidal suggested[19] that instead 
</tt><tt>of using specspo &quot;translating pkgs might best be served by translating 
</tt><tt>the metadata in external files.&quot; In response to Bill Nottingham's 
</tt><tt>skepticism that this was just moving bloat to a new location Seth 
</tt><tt>explained[20] that it would allow only the data specific to the 
</tt><tt>requested language to be fetched. In a further explanation he 
</tt><tt>provided[21] an overview of the ideal mechanism which would allow 
</tt><tt>translations only for the language in use to be installed. This involved 
</tt><tt>yum downloading translations from a language-segmented repodata and 
</tt><tt>inserting those translations into the local rpmdb. A further reason to 
</tt><tt>find an alternative to specspo was advanced[22] by Stepan Kaspal when he 
</tt><tt>drew attention to its lack of friendliness to third-party repositories: 
</tt><tt>&quot;the specspo solution is not extensible at all; if you add a third part 
</tt><tt>repository, the messages just are not there. And the repository cannot 
</tt><tt>install another catalogue, rpm uses just 'the catalogue'.&quot;

-- Are Other Distros Controlling Fedora through PackageKit ? --

</pre><tt>A thread initiated[24] by Thorsten Leemhuis explored some details on how 
</tt><tt>information on packages is created and stored at the distribution level 
</tt><tt>and the challenges this presents both to independent repositories and to 
</tt><tt>tools which wish to use this data. One heated aspect of this discussion 
</tt><tt>concerned the manner in which the PackageKit[25] application installer 
</tt><tt>defines and presents groupings of packages. PackageKit is designed to be 
</tt><tt>a distribution-independent tool and it appeared to some in the 
</tt><tt>discussion that its direction was inimical to the best 
</tt><tt>release-engineering practices of the Fedora Project. The central issue 
</tt><tt>appeared to be that PackageKit developers were not spending time helping 
</tt><tt>to refine the comps.xml file which defines how packages are bundled 
</tt><tt>during installation and is used by every other tool.

</pre><tt>Thorsten asked a series of questions about the correct use of comps.xml 
</tt><tt>and how it interacted with anaconda, PackageKit and yum. Thorsten was 
</tt><tt>concerned that there appeared to be 1711 packages missing from comps.xml 
</tt><tt>in order that &quot;[...] people can find and select them right during 
</tt><tt>install with anaconda. Do we care?&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>After some investigation with the latest PackageKit, which Rahul 
</tt><tt>Sundaram pointed out[26] uses comps.xml, Thorsten deduced[27] in 
</tt><tt>discussion with Tim Lauridsen that &quot;[...] adding packages to a group in 
</tt><tt>comps.xml as '&lt;packagereq type=&quot;optional&quot;&gt;' is only worth the trouble if 
</tt><tt>you want to make the package selectable in anaconda, as that information 
</tt><tt>is not used by pk-application.&quot; Tim Lauridsen explained[28] that 
</tt><tt>PackageKit used the comps.xml groups as &quot;meta-packages&quot; but James Antill 
</tt><tt>disagreed[29] that they were similar.

</pre><tt>In sustained discussion with Kevin Kofler a defense of PackageKit was 
</tt><tt>mounted[32] by Richard Hughes using the argument that it was intended to 
</tt><tt>be a compliment to yum rather than a replacement. Its intent is to 
</tt><tt>occupy a very narrow niche for the specific type of user identified by 
</tt><tt>&quot;profiles&quot; produced by the PackageKit developers.

</pre><tt>The evolution of comps.xml to its current complexity was advanced[34] by 
</tt><tt>Nicolas Mailhot as the result of multiple constraints of engineering,

</pre><tt>When it seemed that PackageKit was being designed[35] to take the needs 
</tt><tt>of other distributions into account and that this might have a negative 
</tt><tt>effect on Fedora there was a great deal of disapprobation expressed[36] 
</tt><tt>by Jesse Keating: &quot;If I'd known that upstream was actively looking to 
</tt><tt>destroy our package classifications, rather than actually work with us 
</tt><tt>to clean them up a bit maybe I would have joined the conversation. A 
</tt><tt>heads up might have been in order. I fear that any conversation now will 
</tt><tt>just be too little too late.&quot; Matthias Clasen characterized[37] this as 
</tt><tt>Jesse being more interested in confrontation than making things better 
</tt><tt>but Nicolas Mailhot also saw[38] the decisions being made about 
</tt><tt>PackageKit's design as &quot;non-representative&quot; of developers focused on 
</tt><tt>Fedora. Interestingly he tied this in with an observation on &quot;[...] 
</tt><tt>desktop team mislike for the common distro communication channel [.]&quot; A 
</tt><tt>slight rapprochement seemed[39] to be in effect towards the end of the

</pre><tt>The issue of binary packages (several of which can be produced from any 
</tt><tt>single source package) was attacked when Toshio Kuratomi listed[40] 
</tt><tt>PackageDB, amber, koji,comps.xml, repoview and Fedora collection as all 
</tt><tt>&quot;[...] doing a subset of the work in this area.&quot; He asked for some 
</tt><tt>clarity as to the storage, interface and presentation layers. Kevin 
</tt><tt>Fenzi agreed but added[41] mash as another player and suggested that 
</tt><tt>perhaps all the developers of the respective systems could meet to hash 
</tt><tt>out some agreed plan. Jesse Keating confirmed[42] Kevin's description 
</tt><tt>and elaborated: &quot;it's mash that pulls comps out of cvs and 'makes' it 
</tt><tt>and uses it when generating repodata. Mash is used during rawhide 
</tt><tt>production and during update repo generation. When we make releases, 
</tt><tt>that uses pungi which consumes the comps data that mash generated and 
</tt><tt>merges in data from any other repo pungi is configured to use. Then 
</tt><tt>pungi calls repoview to create data based on that merged comps.&quot;

-- The fight for the theme --

</pre><tt>As the vote for the Fedora 10 theme was closed to the members of the Art 
</tt><tt>Team, a lot of people tried to vote even if they weren't members of the 
</tt><tt>team, as Mairin Duffy noted[1]: &quot;Since i announced the F10 theme vote, 
</tt><tt>we've received a deluge of art group membership requests, some clearly 
</tt><tt>approveable but many not&quot; and she reminded the requirements to become a 
</tt><tt>member, which are listed on the project's page[2]. David Nielsen tried 
</tt><tt>an appeal on her blog[3] &quot;Maybe the solution is to open the vote, even 
</tt><tt>if we are not inclined to contribute in your area of Fedora we might 
</tt><tt>still have an opinion. Do you want other contributors to make decisions 
</tt><tt>on the projects collective future without including you?&quot; but Mairin 
</tt><tt>remained firm &quot;As an artist, I don't expect to have a vote on many 
</tt><tt>technical decisions. I wonder how someone without both the experience 
</tt><tt>and inclination to provide artwork for Fedora would have the expertise 
</tt><tt>necessary to make an informed decision&quot; and concluded &quot;Everyone has an 
</tt><tt>opinion. Not everyone is willing to put their money where their mouth 
</tt><tt>is. It is a shame.&quot;

-- The theme soap opera --

</pre><tt>While the vote for the Fedora 10 theme was ongoing, Seth Kenlon 
</tt><tt>reminded[1] an old issue with one of the contenders and asked for an 
</tt><tt>update &quot;I am not clear, is this to be the final katana or is it still 
</tt><tt>being swapped out with a newly photographed one? I recall there being an 
</tt><tt>issue with licensing, and thought we would be seeing a different 
</tt><tt>sword...but maybe I missed the thread in which all of this was solved&quot; 
</tt><tt>on which Nicu Buculei expressed[2] his remaining doubts &quot;Honestly, I 
</tt><tt>have some doubts about that: sstorari *claimed* he remade the image 
</tt><tt>using his own (Free) photo as a base and he posted the reference photo: 
</tt><tt><a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/sstorari/2826852493/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/sstorari/2826852493/</a> While it looks pretty 
</tt><tt>much like a katana (just like the photos used previously), the sword in 
</tt><tt>the photo is not at the same angle as the sword in the wallpaper (so the 
</tt><tt>hilt looks different), which make me have some doubts&quot;, which raised an 
</tt><tt>angry answer[3] from Samuele Storari, the theme author, who claimed 
</tt><tt>innocence &quot;If u take a look in the source before write something u can 
</tt><tt>see that the problem was solved creatin' the blade from 0.&quot;

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>When the discuss started to look like a classic flamewar, Paul Frields 
</tt><tt>dropped a bomb by showing[4] a movie poster identical with the theme 
</tt><tt>discussed &quot;Samuele, I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, and collected 
</tt><tt>some desktop backgrounds when Kill Bill Vol. 1 was going to be released. 
</tt><tt>One of the backgrounds features a katana sword which looks to me to be 
</tt><tt>identical to the one in your source .XCF file&quot; and outlined the 
</tt><tt>importance of having all of the elements of a design Free in order to 
</tt><tt>have the result Free &quot;When we talk about having an entirely free desktop 
</tt><tt>theme, it means that *all* the elements must be created from free sources.&quot;

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>As Samuele continued to deny any wrongdoing &quot;the Blade wasn't the same 
</tt><tt>cos the blade was totally recreated. Take a look to the source file and 
</tt><tt>please post something similar&quot;, Nicu Buculei created and posted[6] a 
</tt><tt>short video[7] revealing the similarities &quot;What can I say? rotate the 
</tt><tt>image 180 degrees and the resemblance is, uh..., uncanny&quot;

</pre><tt>During the heated debate, Martin Sourada expressed[8] his doubts 
</tt><tt>regarding the allegations against the two themes proposed by Samuele. 
</tt><tt>&quot;First, I have an impression that Mo and Nicu are somehow biased against 
</tt><tt>Samuele's work. First, some weeks ago, Mo kept asking Samuele about Moon 
</tt><tt>brushes in the Solar theme, when the Moons were already removed from the 
</tt><tt>artwork, next there is the problem in katana. As nicu pointed out, the 
</tt><tt>original design indeed resembles the Kill Bill poster, but even though I 
</tt><tt>saw the .ogv file he provided, I am not 100% convinced Samuele used that 
</tt><tt>katana&quot; and &quot;I believe both Mo and Nicu are just trying to prevent any 
</tt><tt>legal issues that might arose in the future otherwise&quot; but after seeing 
</tt><tt>additional evidence provided by Mairin Duffy[9] and Charlie Brej[10] he 
</tt><tt>changed his position &quot;Mo and Nicu, I'd like to apologize for accusing 
</tt><tt>you from being biased and pointing out outdated issues. It was me who 
</tt><tt>was wrong and I should have checked the sources first. While part of the 
</tt><tt>sword was replaced, the tilt was indeed from the same source image and I 
</tt><tt>was wrong in arguing otherwise.&quot;

</pre><tt>After the vote ended and after a long and heated debate, Samuele Storari

</tt><tt>themes proposals and remove a number of tainted graphic elements from 
</tt><tt>them. At the moment of this report, Samuele is closely collaborating 
</tt><tt>with other members of the team on this task and the Solar theme cleaned 
</tt><tt>almost completely.

-- Lessons from the flamewar --

</pre><tt>In parallel with the debate surrounding the license of a couple of theme 
</tt><tt>proposals for Fedora 10, Mairin Duffy opened a debate[1] about the 
</tt><tt>policy to apply when finding license infringements &quot;Here are the options 
</tt><tt>as I see them and/or as have been suggested to me: 1 - disqualify 
</tt><tt>invinXble as a theme, even if invinXble wins, the 2nd-place winner will 
</tt><tt>win 2 - if invinXble (or any theme that has photos we aren't able to 
</tt><tt>source) wins, replace any sourced photographs in it with 
</tt><tt>properly-licensed ones 3 - disqualify any themes that use images we 
</tt><tt>cannot find properly-licensed photo source references for&quot;, she noted 
</tt><tt>the pros and contras for each option and expressed her option for one of 
</tt><tt>the first two. David Nielsen raised the case[2] for a written policy &quot;I 
</tt><tt>would favor option 2 with the understanding that a proper policy be 
</tt><tt>written and must be agreed upon when submitting artwork for Fedora in 
</tt><tt>the future. This way we do not lose the two most developed themes this 
</tt><tt>late in the game and we still get to correct the problem. This at least 
</tt><tt>would be similar to what we have done in other parts of the distro when 
</tt><tt>such unfortunate issues have arisen&quot;, a policy considered not needed[4] 
</tt><tt>by Nicu Buculei &quot;Well, I propose a simple guideline: 'Don't like. When 
</tt><tt>people ask about the source of your work, be honest and tell the truth.' 
</tt><tt>That would have solved all of our problems *weeks* ago, but I think it 
</tt><tt>is common-sense and we should not have to have this as a written 
</tt><tt>guideline. &quot;

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>As a lesson from the happening, Mairin Duffy asked[4] on @fedora-art 
</tt><tt>about unclarities some member of the team may have about licensing: &quot;Did 
</tt><tt>any of you joining the art team have doubts/questions/confusion over 
</tt><tt>copyright law and licensing as it pertains to the usage of 
</tt><tt>externally-sourced images used in artwork? Were you unsure of what 
</tt><tt>licenses were acceptable to use in Fedora artwork? What kinds of 
</tt><tt>questions / uncertainties did you have, if any?&quot; and proposed a few 
</tt><tt>measures, on which David Nielsen completed[5] with a couple of simple 
</tt><tt>guidelines &quot;* Unsure about source licensing terms, don't use it. * 
</tt><tt>Unable to document source licensing terms, don't use it.&quot;

-- Echo icon theme and Fedora 10 --

</pre><tt>Bill Nottingham raised[1] a cross-question to @fedora-art and 
</tt><tt>@fedora-desktop about the status of the Echo icon theme &quot;When we 
</tt><tt>approved Echo as the default icon theme for F10, I was under the 
</tt><tt>assumption that this was already more or less known as a feature to the 
</tt><tt>Desktop group, and they were OK with the coverage provided and the 
</tt><tt>experience given. Is that the case?&quot; on which William Jon McCann 
</tt><tt>expressed[2] his opposition to the new theme &quot;I strongly disagree with 
</tt><tt>the decision to use the Echo icon theme. For one, there is simply not 
</tt><tt>enough time before Fedora 10 to fix the problems that you point out. 
</tt><tt>There is also the fact that the quality of the artwork is noticeably 
</tt><tt>lower than the upstream GNOME and Tango icon themes&quot; and preference for 
</tt><tt>the Tango set &quot;Encourage Fedora artists to become involved with the 
</tt><tt>upstream GNOME and Tango artist communities&quot; while Mairin Duffy 
</tt><tt>pointed[3] the inclusion of Echo as a default in Rawhide as a means to 
</tt><tt>enable wider testing and accelerate development |I also was under the 
</tt><tt>understanding that Echo was set as the default in rawhide to enable the 
</tt><tt>folks working on it a chance to get fuller coverage, and that if it was 
</tt><tt>deemed to not have appropriate coverage, it would be pulled.&quot;

</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Martin Sourada pointed[4] that some of the concern raised in Bill's 
</tt><tt>original questions are also valid for the current situation &quot;With Mist, 
</tt><tt>there are still new gnome styled icons, old gnome styled icons and 
</tt><tt>bluecurve. In some places we reduced the old gnome and bluecurve to 
</tt><tt>minimum, in others not yet. Check the System -&gt; Administration menu as 
</tt><tt>an example&quot; and reminded there is still development time until the final 
</tt><tt>decision about inclusion will be made &quot;Our general idea is that some 
</tt><tt>time around the final freeze it will be decided by art and desktop teams 
</tt><tt>whether we are ready. If not, echo will be pulled back and submitted 
</tt><tt>again for F11. I'd be for voting, enabled for art and desktop fas groups 
</tt><tt>members regarding this issue&quot; and Jaroslav Reznik showed the enthusiasm 
</tt><tt>of the KDE SIG[5] regarding the new set and his openness to work for 
</tt><tt>getting it in a good shape &quot;We (KDE SIG) are trying to use Echo theme as 
</tt><tt>default for KDE but currently there are still some icons missing. We are 
</tt><tt>preparing list of to-be-done icons. So can we fill it as ticket for 
</tt><tt>echo-icon-theme and edit Todo on Wiki?&quot;

</tt><tt>on a 32bit system running Fedora 8 dom0, the shutdown or restart of a 
</tt><tt>Fedora 9 domU results in that guest being inaccessible to libvirt tools 
</tt><tt>until a dom0 reboot or xend restart. There are at least two similar 
</tt><tt>bugs[3],[4] filed for this issue.

-- Libvirt 0.4.6 Released --

</pre><tt>Daniel Veillard announced[1] the release of libvirt 0.4.6. &quot;There is no 
</tt><tt>major change in this release, just the bug fixes a few improvements and 
</tt><tt>some cleanup&quot;.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Improvements include:

    * add storage disk volume delete (Cole Robinson)
    * KVM dynamic max CPU detection (Guido Günther)
    * spec file improvement for minimal builds (Ben Guthro)
    * improved error message in XM configuration module (Richard Jones)
    * network config in OpenVZ support (Evgeniy Sokolov)
</pre><tt>    * enable stopping a pool in logical storage backend and cleanup 
</tt><tt>deletion of pool (Chris Lalancette)

</pre><tt>After finding no F8 build newer than 0.4.4 in Bodhi, Dale Bewley 
</tt><tt>asked[2] if the Xen users stuck[3] on Fedora 8 could expect an update[4].
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Daniel Veillard responded[5] it was unclear the release would fix 
</tt><tt>anything for Xen users and &quot;It was looking more risky than potentially 
</tt><tt>useful to update there.&quot;

both the oVirt Node and oVirt Server Suite.

New features in this release include:

</pre><tt>    * Addition of 'Smart Pools' in the Web user interface for 
</tt><tt>organizing pools on a per user basis.
</tt><tt>    * Additions to the Edit VM screen to allow re-provisioning of a 
</tt><tt>guest as well editing other guest settings.
</tt><tt>    * oVirt Appliance manages VMs directly on the host it is running 
</tt><tt>on. This eliminates the 'fake nodes' used in previous versions.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
    * oVirt API (Ruby Bindings)
</pre><tt>    * Support for configuring more than one NIC per Node. UI support 
</tt><tt>for this will be integrated shortly.
</tt><tt>    * Support for bonding/failover of NICs. UI support for this will be 
</tt><tt>integrated shortly.

-- Modeling LVM Storage --

</pre><tt>Chris Lalancette described[1] the outcome of a IRC chat about carving up 
</tt><tt>storage with LVM.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>The existing StoragePool in the current model contains zero or more 
</tt><tt>StorageVolumes. Chris described adding a StorageVolume of type LVM which 
</tt><tt>contains one or more iSCSI StorageVolumes and presumably fiberchannel in 
</tt><tt>the future.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>After the model is modified and the backend &quot;taskomatic&quot; code is in 
</tt><tt>place, then while provisioning a guest VM the user will either choose an 
</tt><tt>entire LUN guest, choose an existing logical volume, or create a new volume.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00313.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00313.html</a>

</pre><tt>Scott Seago clarified[2] that &quot;volumes must be of the same 'type' as the 
</tt><tt>pool&quot;. An IscsiStoragePool contains IscsiStorageVolumes an 
</tt><tt>LvmStoragePool contains LvmStorageVolumes. &quot;In additon, for 
</tt><tt>LvmStoragePools, we have a new association defined between it and 
</tt><tt>StorageVolumes. an LvmStoragePool has 1 or more &quot;source storage 
</tt><tt>volumes&quot;&quot;... &quot;which for the moment must be IscsiStorageVolumes.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>&quot;When determining which storage volumes are available for guests, we'll 
</tt><tt>have to filter out storage volumes which are connected to LvmStoragePools.&quot;
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Steve Ofsthun asked[3] how will oVirt distinguish between logical 
</tt><tt>volumes created on a whole disk assigned to a guest versus volumes used 
</tt><tt>by the host. Daniel P. Berrange suggested[4] this could accomplished by 
</tt><tt>creating a partition on the disk and assigning this to the guest,
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">
thereby making the guest LVM one step removed from the host.

<pre>Due to needing some more time for new features to mature a bit before we
cut our Beta, we've decided to move the Beta release date back to
Tuesday Sept 30th.

This move, combined with previous schedule slips has also driven us to
extend the rest of the Fedora 10 schedule dates by a week, resulting in
a final release date of Tuesday Nov. 25th.

Fedora 10 feature owners--rescue your unfinished feature pages!

John Poelstra reminded[0] everyone that the feature freeze for Fedora 10
is coming soon, and that feature owners need to get their pages updated
to ensure that the features that belong in F10 get in, and that the
features that need to be deferred to F11 are deferred. &quot;Please complete
this as soon as possible so that we can prepare an accurate beta release
announcement. FESCo will also be reviewing the complete feature list at
its next meeting on Wednesday, September 17, 2008, and determining which
incomplete features should remain.&quot;

Fedora 10 and translations: String freeze and repackaging

Dimitris Glezos reminded[2] us &quot;that shipped packages for which Fedora
is upstream for are string frozen since the Beta freeze of September 11:
no translatable strings can be added or modified for Fedora 10.&quot;

Fedora intrustion update

Paul Frields issued[3] his latest updated regarding the Fedora security
breach that has been news during the past few weeks. &quot;Work on the Fedora
infrastructure has returned to normal at this point. Updates are once
again available for Fedora 8 and Fedora 9, our current releases, using
the new package signing key we've implemented.&quot;

Warren Togami announced[1] the creation of a new list for
NSPluginWrapper. &quot;NSPluginwrapper Development discussion with the goal
of isolating issues and collaboratively working on solutions should go
on this list. There was some interest from other Linux distributions and
even Adobe to cooperate on the future of nspluginwrapper
development[2].&quot;

open-source upstream for Red Hat Satellite. There is a list of features,
enhancements, bug fixes, and credits on Jesus' blog.

Greg DeKoenigsberg helped[5] the OLPC folks recruit volunteers to be
part of their growing infrastructure team. &quot;OLPC builds a lot of
packages. They are looking to set up and maintain an infrastructure that
will allow them to meet their own unique packaging needs. They need a
volunteer with a strong understanding of the Fedora packaging process --
one who either understands koji now, or can learn to understand it in
fairly short order.&quot;

My favorite Planet post this week came[6] from Fedora Board member Matt
Domsch, and it is worth people's time to read the entire post, to gain a
lot of insight into how Fedora's mass rebuilds work, and what triggers
them.

&quot;One challenge to self-hosting a project the size of Fedora (now with
about 6200 source packages) is dealing with the interdependencies
between packages. When a major component, such as the compiler or an
often-used library, upgrades to a new version, you should rebuild all
packages that depend upon that major component, to ensure they continue
to work. Often, simply re-compiling or re-linking each package using the
updated compiler or library is all that is needed. In some cases though,
applications which once built, no longer do - bitrot has set in.&quot;

Legal

Tom Callaway wrote[1] a lengthy post about the Mozilla EULA controversy,
which reared its head again this week in the context of Ubuntu and
Mozilla. However, Fedora dealt with this problem several months ago, at
the end of the Fedora 9 release cycle.

Spot's entire post is worth reading, as is the commentary that follows
it. Here is one excerpt:

&quot;[The] goal was always to ensure that we could walk away with license
terms from Mozilla that:

1. Permitted Fedora to continue using the Firefox trademarks 2. Clearly
upheld the MPL as the valid software license terms for the Firefox
binaries and source (not just for Fedora, but for everyone) 3. Meet the
criteria for Free Software 4. Are presented to the user in a
non-obtrusive, non-clickthrough agreement way&quot;

Free B license, which has long been a thorn in the side of various
distros.

=== Events &amp; Ambassadors ===

The North American Fedora Ambassador Day is coming up at Ohio Linux Fest
in October, and there were a few posts about it on Planet this week.
Brian Powell gave[1] an update on the organization, saying:

&quot;There have been quite a few discussions and meetings recently in
regards to FAD planning. There has been a lot of good progress and great
ideas coming out of these. With time getting close, we are looking at
finalizing the Agenda and Schedule for FADNA shortly.

If you are a North American Ambassador I would ask that you take a
moment to look at what we have come up with so far and a 'tentative'
schedule of events located at the FADNA2008 wiki page. If you have
anything to add feel free to do so.&quot;

Additionally, Karsten Wade wrote[2] a post about strategies for handling
remote meetings, and making a physical gathering of a small number of
people into a larger meeting that remotees can attend and still get
value out of, whether that attendance is via IRC, telephone, or
something collaborative like gobby.

&quot;Think about your sessions and how it can help to interact with the rest
of us. I recommend a minimum of: live video feed, live audio feed, and
IRC, Gobby, and wiki editing projected on the wall. We can also keep a
VoIP conference room open, but my instinct is to limit the flow on the
incoming voices by subject matter. Beyond that recommendation, a live
IRC and wiki-based abd/or Gobby note taking with many laptops in the

David Nalley wrote up[3] a trip report for Linux Demo Day in Charleston,
SC. &quot;About 60 people showed up. Charlestons LUG is relatively new, and
this was their first event. They seemed very pleased. I handed about 30
LiveCDs out and talked with a number of Fedora. In addition I spoke to
2-3 people who were intrigued with contributing to Fedora in one way or
another. Ill be following up with these individuals.&quot; This is a great
example of an event -- low cost, but high touch!

Plug and Run Fedora on a TOSHIBA A300D laptop

This post recounted[1] some adventures with Fedora and a very tricky
laptop. It is always good to know about such success stories. Some
laptops do not even start GNU/Linux at all! But this one seemed to work
pretty well with Fedora.

=== Removal of non-X Consoles (continued) ===

The furore over the future removal of text-mode consoles (see FWN#144
&quot;Non-X System Consoles to be Removed&quot;[1]) continued throughout the week.
The original thread saw some support for the idea expressed[2] by
Nicolas Mailhot on the basis that &quot;[...] non-X-console input is a mess
[...] font support has fossilized, and support for modern high
resolution screens is severely lacking [...]&quot; Nicholas was especially
concerned[3] with the maintenance burden imposed by the text-mode
console &quot;[...] as someone who is an upstream maintainer for my language
of some of the bits the console use[s].&quot;

Upon being pressed by Dominik Mierzejewski for evidence of a lack of
proper maintenance Nicolas listed[4] a series of problems including the
stagnation of the console layout database and the console font set.
Dmitry Butskoy begged[5] to separate the concepts of &quot;console&quot; and
&quot;serial tty&quot; and also for the retention of the text-mode console.
Dominik promised to try to find a colleague to shoulder the maintenance
burden but Nicolas had already given up[6] in disgust. In response
elsewhere to Seth Vidal's argument that the text console did no harm and
should be left alone Nicholas expanded[7] on the maintenance costs of
&quot;all sorts of packaging rules designed to avoid hitting console
limitations and problems&quot; and bugs filed because of the confusion caused
by two text stacks.

Les Mikesell got to the heart of the problem when he asked[8] &quot;I think
I'm confused by the term 'non X consoles'. Is that something different
than the native text mode you see before X starts?&quot; He also recommended
using FreeNX/NX instead of using the console. Nicolas responded[9] that
there were &quot;[...]two different things. A VT to which you can attach an X
session, a serial port, a remote SSH, mingetty... and the software stack
used to display locally the VT text and collect user input.&quot; Nicolas saw
the &quot;low-level VT bit&quot; as fundamentally sound but the &quot;current console
software stack&quot; as &quot;rotten.&quot; Les sought[10] further clarification of
this distinction between &quot;[...] the low level part that works in
character mode and expects some hardware to supply and render the fonts
[...]&quot; and &quot;[...] software other than X that renders custom fonts[.]&quot;

Denis Leroy wondered[11] if there was &quot;[...] an X-based mingetty
replacement actually exists ? Something that's proven to be sufficiently
fail-safe (will work even with half-broken X configurations and such?)&quot;
and although Nicolas did not know of one he speculated[12] &quot;[...] as
soon as much of the hardware pocking is moved from xorg to the kernel
and X can be run as a normal user &quot;X-based mingetty replacement&quot; will be
just running a x term fullscreen in an autoconfigured X instance. Of
course one could theoretically write a much lighter solution using only
freetype (cairo, pango?) and an xkb-config parser.&quot; Denis's concern
seemed to be that often a Ctrl+Alt+F1 to mingetty was the only way to
kill hanging desktop applications. Colin Walters suggested[13] making
&quot;[...] Ctrl-Alt-Backspace just break server grabs instead of killing the
server (and of course fix the bugs in the apps that hang while holding a
server grab).&quot;

There were multiple expressions of disapprobation often coupled with use
cases. Some of these led Chris Snook to exclaim[14] &quot;Unless I've missed
something huge, virtual terminals aren't going away. What may or may not
be going away is the x86 video BIOS text mode, to be replaced with a
kernel framebuffer, which precludes the use of console fonts, which very
few people ever mess with. The console itself will remain. Someone
please correct me if I'm wrong.&quot; [[DaveAirlie|Dave Airlie] confirmed[15]
this understanding and added &quot;[...] vga text mode will not be enabled by
default, you will need to pass nomodeset if you want to use vga text
mode. Welcome to the 1990s.&quot; Alan Cox made[16] the correction that
framebuffer console support fonts but that framebuffers did not work on
all machines, screen reader technology and remote management cards.

=== OpenVPN and resolv.conf ===

Ahmed Kamal asked[1] for help in scratching an itch and started a
concise, meaty thread. His particular problem was that he wanted to
overwrite /etc/resolv.conf with new DNS servers obtained over a vpn
tunnel, this is apparently done automatically in &quot;Windows&quot;.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01304.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01304.html</a>

The suggestion to use NetworkManager was made by Paul Wouters and Dan
Williams agreed[2] and added the explanation that it &quot;[...] mediate[d]
between services [including PPP, PPtP, DHCP, openvpn, and vpnc] that
need to update your DNS information.&quot; The alternative is that each
service needs to handle /etc/resolv.conf itself.

[2]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01313.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01313.html</a>

The idea of a default caching daemon was floated[3] by Simo Sorce. As he
envisioned it, the services/tools, such as OpenVPN, would &quot;[...] tell
the caching daemon which IP ranges and which domains their provided
forwarders should be consulted for. All dynamic so that as soon as one
daemon goes away, the caching DNS will notice and revert queries to the
default DNS.} Nils Philippsen agreed[4] heartily and added that
&quot;[i]deally, it should be something which isn't restricted to class A/B/C
like reverse DNS (seems to be), but which would route DNS requests based
on arbitrary domain name or IP-range criteria to the desired name
servers&quot; and Paul Howarth provided[5] the further reason that changes to
/etc/resolv.conf are often not picked up by processes. This latter point
spawned a discussion on the demerits of the glibc stub resolver (which
is too simplistic) and the consequent use of the deprecated
gethostbyname in individual applications. Dan Williams recommended using
lwresd (a stripped-down, caching-only nameserver available to clients
which use the BIND 9 lightweight resolver library) or for more complex
setups a local caching nameserver. Although Simo Sorce disagreed[6] with
Dan that many applications were simply using gethostbyname he agreed
that &quot;[a] caching nameserver that can be instructed what to do when
conditions change is what we really need.&quot;

Ahmed asked[7] whether dnsmasq or other daemons were able to &quot;[direct]
name resolution to specific servers according to IP ranges and/or domain
names, with the option of adding/removing servers on the fly?&quot; and
Richard W.M. Jones[8] confirmed that this was indeed possible. Adam Tkac
suggested[9] that this could be done with view statements in BIND and
the gauntlet of how to do this for CIDR and domain names was thrown
down[10] by Nils. A detailed sub-thread followed which indicated what
while possible it was not pretty.

Adam Tkac shared[11] the information that his TODO list includes the
addition of NetworkManager support to BIND and Simo Sorce explained [12]
that nscd was not a solution for a local caching nameserver &quot;[...] as
not all type of queries can be fulfilled by the glibc interface. For
example SRV/TXT records ... Also nscd is not smart enough to understand
network condition and adapt it's behavior.&quot; Simo agreed that it would be
nice if &quot;[...] bind could consult different DNSs based 1) on the DNS
name to be queried, and B) the reverse IP to be queried&quot; so that on slow
links only the necessary queries would be directed through the VPN.

=== Fedora 10 Feature Owner Request ===

John Poelstra requested[1] all those owning a Feature[2] to take some
actions on their feature page so that the beta release notes and
announcements are accurate. He provided a list of twenty one feature
pages which &quot;have not been updated since the Feature Freeze on
2008-09-11 and/or are not 100% complete.&quot;

Kevin Kofler was among those who had been watching the progress of
OpenChange (see FWN#133 &quot;Help Wanted: Samba4, Heimdahl, OpenChange&quot;[3])
and noted[4] that due to the decision[5] of Andrew Bartlett to orphan
the feature it needed a new owner if Fedora 11 was to offer OpenChange.

Another of the listed pages was that for the Echo icon theme and Luya
Tshimbalanga asked if he should add a release note to the effect that
echo was now the default. Rahul Sundaram confirmed that this would be
helpful.

The Eclipse-3.4 (Ganymede) page was updated[6] by [JeffJohnston|Jeff
Johnston]].

=== system-autodeath Becomes Reality ===

Seth Vidal announced[1] that he had implemented his previously discussed
(FWN#140 &quot;System Autodeath&quot;[2]) idea to automatically remove networking
capabilities from machines which lacked system updates. The intent is to
prevent non-maintained machines from being exploited.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01716.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01716.html</a>

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FWN/Issue140#System.Autodeath">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FWN/Issue140#System.Autodeath</a>

Seth implemented the concept as a daily cronjob which tests a configured
&quot;death date&quot; against the current time. For the week leading up to the
&quot;death date&quot; log messages warn that on the specific date the default
route will be deleted. He requested feedback and improvements.

Matt Miller was content but suggested[3] beefing up the manpage with
details of the consequences of removing the default route. Seth noted
that he was happy to accept patches.

A fraught note was introduced when Stephen Warren declared[4] that if
this were a default then, in combination with the proposed textconsole
removal (see this FWN#144 &quot;Removal of non-X Consoles (continued)&quot;) and
the modesetting changes[5], he was thinking about switching distros.
Rahul Sundaram responded[6] that modesetting was going to be a feature
of all distros soon and the conversation veered[7] into explaining that
the replacement for RHGB, named &quot;Plymouth&quot; had a sane text-mode fallback
for unsupported chipsets. As much of Stephen's angst was due to a
perceived abandonment of those using non-Free drivers Rahul pointed out
that the nouveau drivers might work. Richard Hughes listed[8] 2-D and
xrandr as supported with kernel modesetting coming soon due to Maarten
Maathuis's work. He warned: &quot;Don't even try 3D yet. It does work, but
only if the moon is waxing, and your pet cat is called Oliver.&quot;

Back on the main topic of the thread Seth stated[9] that
system-autodeath was not intended to be part of the default install:
&quot;This is just a nicety for sysadmins or local-respin maintainers who
would like to put a dropdead date on their releases.&quot; In response to
Stephen's recollection Seth also stated[10] this point clearly. A
general disagreement with the idea of exposing such a feature was
expressed[11] by James Hubbard on the basis that the user should be
forced to change a config file to prevent against accidental
installation errors.

=== Fedora Not &quot;Free&quot; Enough for GNU? ===

A long-running thread which was started[1] on 07-09-2008 by Michel Salim
continues to attracted some heated discussion over the fact that Fedora
is not recognized as a 100% Free software distribution by GNU although a
derivative named &quot;BLAG&quot; (see also FWN#139[2]) is recognized as FLOSS.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00428.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00428.html</a>

The central stumbling block seemed[3] to be best stated by Gregory
Maxwell as &quot;[...] Fedora doesn't yet strip the binary firmware provided
by the Linux kernel (and still provides some re-distributable binary
firmware in other packages, the microcode package and alsa-firmware I
think).&quot; Gregory described the situation as unfortunate due to both the
lack &quot;[...] of acknowledgement it deserves, and the FSF is indirectly
promoting Ubuntu, a distribution which is, as far as I can tell, a
primary driving factor in new users using and depending on proprietary
software.&quot; This latter being a reference to the recognition of gNewSense
as FLOSS.

There had been previous very heated threads on this subject (during one
of FWN's holidays) centered around the efforts of Alexandre Oliva to
produce a &quot;kernel-libre&quot; and the interaction of this project with other
efforts and approaches within the kernel community. David Woodhouse
added[4] the excellent news that &quot;We are almost at the point where we
can do a spin which remedies [the difficulties of stripping out the
non-Free firmware].&quot; He explained that soon a completely separate
package instead of a sub-package of the normal kernel build will allow
others to produce alternative packages of firmwares for which source
code is available. Tom Callaway was worried[5] that there was still
firmware entangled in the kernel source code and noted the need for an
audit. Rahul Sundaram supplied[6] a link to a Debian inventory of
firmwares.

Other interesting points in the discussion touched on the rationales
which have been often advanced for refusing to supply source to
firmwares. These involve regulatory compliance (often for radio
devices). Alan Cox was suspicious of such arguments based[7] on the
history of examples such as ISDN code which &quot;[...] was approved. You
could change it but then it became unapproved and not permitted in some
countries.&quot; He described this as a racket run by the phone companies
which imploded once the need to ensure robustness became important (due
to terrorist threats.) Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams listed[8] some of the
other rationales.

== Translation ==

This section covers the news surrounding the Fedora Translation (L10n)
Project.

Contributing Writer: Runa Bhattacharjee

=== 2008-10-14 Declared Fedora 10 Package Translation Deadline ===

The last date for submission of translations for Fedora 10 packages was
announced[1] as 2008-10-14 (Tuesday). This announcement was made after
an unanimous decision by the Fedora L10n Steering Committee (FLSCo)
members. The last date for the translation of Documents remains as
2008-10-21 (Tuesday).

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-trans-list/2008-September/msg00050.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-trans-list/2008-September/msg00050.html</a>

A request for rebuilding of packages post the translation freeze date,
was also made[2] to the @fedora-devel-announcement list.

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-announce/2008-September/msg00013.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-announce/2008-September/msg00013.html</a>

&quot;Maintainers of the above packages need to put a reminder to issue a new
build *later* than this date and before the Development Freeze of 21/10.
The closer to the development freeze the rebuild takes place, the better
for our translators. If you have not received any translations since the
last build, a rebuild is not necessary.&quot;

=== Renewed Call for Volunteers for the L10n Infrastructure ===

Another call was made[3] at the FLSCo meeting held[ on 16th September
2008[4] seeking volunteers for the Fedora L10n infrastructure. The
earlier call was made[5] in April 2008.

Asgeir Frimannsson wrote on the @fedora-infrastructure-list [1] about
his views on the current localisation infrastructure. He summarises the
current infrastructure which is used by the localisation team, which
includes the version control system and other online tools. He also

=== app2 Disk Space ===

Mike McGrath wrote on the @fedora-infrastructure-list[7] about the
recent disk alerts on app2. It seems that the host was not built with
enough disk space similar to app1. It does raise a point about storage
for transifex though. Basically each host running transifex or damned
lies, keeps a local copy of every scm as part of its usage. For
performance reasons that should not change but its something we'll want
to figure out long term. So after the freeze the host is going to be
rebuilt.

Nicu Buculei relayed[1] to @fedora-art a request from the Hans deGoede,
of Games SIG fame: the Project: Starfighter game[2], which used to be
included in Fedora, was discovered to have some non-free graphic files
and needed free replacements for them. Erick Henrique offered[3] his
help &quot;I go to unpack the archive starfighter.pak and to study a form of
I redesign everything in a new style&quot; and Hans promised[4] to code a

=== Infrastructure Change for Fedora Art ===

After an IRC consultation with Mairin Duffy, Martin Sourada proposed[1]
using fedorahosted.org services for the Art team &quot;it might be worth
setting up a fedorahosted.org instance for the Fedora Art Team. Primary
purpose would be to host our release graphics, but it could serve other
purposes as well (e.g. using ticket system for design service come to my
mind)[.]&quot; This initiative was received with open arms by Luya
Tshimbalanga and with some skepticism[3] by Ian Weller &quot;I'm personally
all for the idea, but I knew there were some caveats that we should
definitely look into before we even think about proceeding. I'd also
like to see Mo's input, of course.&quot; and Nicu Buculei stated[4] &quot;I am
strongly against something which would raise the barrier to entry, so a
NO-NO would be to require git to upload sketches (proposals) for the
upcoming release.&quot;

==== Virt-manager and Virtinst Closely Related ====

After upgrading virt-manager to 0.6.0, Maikel Dollé received[1] the
error ImportError: cannot import name Storage. Cole Robinson
explained[2] virt-manager is tied closely with virtinst and installing
virtinst 0.400.0 would likely fix the problem.

==== Migration Support in Virt-manager GUI ====

Shigeki Sakamoto followed[1] up on a previous[2] request for comments on
a patch, submitted by same, which works to allow the migration of
domains from within the virt-manager GUI. Daniel P. Berrange
suggested[3] using a submenu rather than a pop-up window, and commented
on the sanity checks[4] in libvirt.

Live Migration Sanity Checks were recently discussed on @libvir list

=== Fedora Xen List ===

This section contains the discussion happening on the fedora-xen list.

==== DomU Network Interface Problem Leads to Discussion of HVM
Requirements ====

Guillaume[1] asked[1] about a paravirtualized domU which did not show
any network interfaces. There was a suggestion made that this could be
due to a lack of HVM support in the host hardware, which isn't the case.
Paul Wouters cleared[2] up such confusion by describing the main
virtualization techniques used in Fedora. Quoting:

    * Xen hypervisor for para_virt guests does not need HVM. 

    Problem here is that Fedora 8 is the last release to support this
    setup on x86_64, though work is in progress to add this support to
    Fedora 9/10. Para_virt guests are booted via kernel= and rootfs
    images, or via pygrub, which is just a wrapper for grabbing kernel
    from bootable disk images. 

    * Qemu is a software emulator for various architectures including PC
    hardware. 

    It requires no HVM instructions, but it can use them if they exist
    via the kernel &quot;kvm&quot; code. This is how Fedora9 does its VM's via the
    libvirt and virt-install. This does NOT [sic] use or require a xen
    hypervisor. 

    * Xenner is a software emulation for the Xen hypervisor. 

    It requires HVM because it uses the kernel &quot;kvm&quot; code. The idea
    behind Xenner is that you can run VM's based on kernel-xen kernels
    (eg migration from Fedora8) 

Paul went on to mention other[5] virtualization technologies such as
VirtualBox/Vmx, lguest, uml, virtuoso, and openvz.

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-xen/2008-September/msg00018.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-xen/2008-September/msg00018.html</a>

In another post[3] Paul suggested that Guillaume's domU may have an
initrd which lacks xenblk and xennet, and pointed[4] to a debate in the
FC6 era concerning the xenblk kernel module.

=== Libvirt List ===

This section contains the discussion happening on the libvir-list.

==== Minimal Client-only Libvirt Build ====

Ben Guthro patched[1] the libvirt spec file to allow for a minimal
client-only build.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00264.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00264.html</a>

==== Access to CPU Flags ====

Ben Guthro needed[1] to access CPU flags to determine if VMX features
were available, and suggested src/nodeinfo.c would be the place to parse
this. This however raised a concern that adding to the nodeinfo struct
breaks the API. Additionally, since this is an x86 specific change, Ben
wondered if it would be acceptable.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00271.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00271.html</a>

Daniel P. Berrange stated[1] &quot;any struct or API in
include/libvirt/libvirt.h is immutable to preserve ABI&quot;, and the API
shouldn't be specifically x86. Daniel did offer that the most likely
place for exposing CPU flags would be in the capabilities[3] XML format.
Where PAE, VMX, and SVM flags are already exposed.

[2]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00273.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00273.html</a>

[3]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt.html#virConnectGetCapabilities">http://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt.html#virConnectGetCapabilities</a>

Ben noted[4] that Xen will report those flags, but oVirt running KVM
does not, and said &quot;It seems to me that it might be useful for some sort
of &quot;node&quot; info driver, where we might be able to share code for
hypervisor independent info about the physical machine it is running
on.&quot; Daniel pointed[5] to src/nodeinfo.c as &quot;a place for this useful
reusable node info code&quot;.

==== OpenVZ Support ==== 

Anton Protopopov pointed[1] to a previous thread[2] on xml format for
OpenVZ driver, and asked if libvirt supported the xml format for
OpenVZ[3] driver.

== Fedora 10 feature owners--rescue your unfinished feature pages!

John Poelstra reminded[0] everyone that the feature freeze for Fedora 10
is coming soon, and that feature owners need to get their pages updated
to ensure that the features that belong in F10 get in, and that the
features that need to be deferred to F11 are deferred. &quot;Please complete
this as soon as possible so that we can prepare an accurate beta release
announcement. FESCo will also be reviewing the complete feature list at
its next meeting on Wednesday, September 17, 2008, and determining which
incomplete features should remain.&quot;

== Updates to Fedora Packaging Guidelines

Tom Callaway announced[1] the most recent set of revisions to the
Packaging Guidelines, including including Haskell, Lisp, and several
other areas. For the full announcement, read the link below.

== Fedora 10 and translations: String freeze and repackaging

Dimitris Glezos reminded[2] us &quot;that shipped packages for which Fedora
is upstream for are string frozen since the Beta freeze of September 11:
no translatable strings can be added or modified for Fedora 10.&quot;

== Fedora intrustion update

Paul Frields issued[3] his latest updated regarding the Fedora security
breach that has been news during the past few weeks. &quot;Work on the Fedora
infrastructure has returned to normal at this point. Updates are once
again available for Fedora 8 and Fedora 9, our current releases, using
the new package signing key we've implemented.&quot;

Greg DeKoenigsberg is helping the OLPC folks recruit volunteers to be
part of their growing infrastructure team. &quot;OLPC builds a lot of
packages. They are looking to set up and maintain an infrastructure that
will allow them to meet their own unique packaging needs. They need a
volunteer with a strong understanding of the Fedora packaging process --
one who either understands koji now, or can learn to understand it in
fairly short order.&quot;

My favorite Planet post this week comes from Fedora Board member Matt
Domsch, and it is worth people's time to read the entire post, to gain a
lot of insight into how Fedora's mass rebuilds work, and what triggers them.

&quot;One challenge to self-hosting a project the size of Fedora (now with
about 6200 source packages) is dealing with the interdependencies
between packages. When a major component, such as the compiler or an
often-used library, upgrades to a new version, you should rebuild all
packages that depend upon that major component, to ensure they continue
to work. Often, simply re-compiling or re-linking each package using the
updated compiler or library is all that is needed. In some cases though,
applications which once built, no longer do - bitrot has set in.&quot;

== Legal

Tom Callaway wrote a lengthy post about the Mozilla EULA controversy,
which reared its head again this week in the context of Ubuntu and
Mozilla. However, Fedora dealt with this problem several months ago, at
the end of the Fedora 9 release cycle.

Spot's entire post is worth reading, as is the commentary that follows
it. Here is one excerpt:

&quot;[The] goal was always to ensure that we could walk away with license
terms from Mozilla that:

1. Permitted Fedora to continue using the Firefox trademarks 2. Clearly
upheld the MPL as the valid software license terms for the Firefox
binaries and source (not just for Fedora, but for everyone) 3. Meet the
criteria for Free Software 4. Are presented to the user in a
non-obtrusive, non-clickthrough agreement way&quot;

Anthony Green wrote a post that referenced SGI altering its Free B
license, which has long been a thorn in the side of various distros.

== Events &amp; Ambassadors ==

The North American Fedora Ambassador Day is coming up at Ohio Linux Fest
in October, and there were a few posts about it on Planet this week.
Brian Powell gave an update on the organization, saying:

&quot;There have been quite a few discussions and meetings recently in
regards to FAD planning. There has been a lot of good progress and great
ideas coming out of these. With time getting close, we are looking at
finalizing the Agenda and Schedule for FADNA shortly.

If you are a North American Ambassador I would ask that you take a
moment to look at what we have come up with so far and a 'tentative'
schedule of events located at the FADNA2008 wiki page. If you have
anything to add feel free to do so.&quot;

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.rhatters.org/2008/09/17/fadna-2008-update/">http://blog.rhatters.org/2008/09/17/fadna-2008-update/</a>

Additionally, Karsten Wade wrote a post about strategies for handling
remote meetings, and making a physical gathering of a small number of
people into a larger meeting that remotees can attend and still get
value out of, whether that attendance is via IRC, telephone, or
something collaborative like gobby.

&quot;Think about your sessions and how it can help to interact with the rest
of us. I recommend a minimum of: live video feed, live audio feed, and
IRC, Gobby, and wiki editing projected on the wall. We can also keep a
VoIP conference room open, but my instinct is to limit the flow on the
incoming voices by subject matter. Beyond that recommendation, a live
IRC and wiki-based abd/or Gobby note taking with many laptops in the
in-person session is the bare bones, with regular usage of
talk.fedoraproject.org.&quot;

David Nalley wrote up a trip report for Linux Demo Day in Charleston,
SC. &quot;About 60 people showed up. Charleston’s LUG is relatively new, and
this was their first event. They seemed very pleased. I handed about 30
LiveCDs out and talked with a number of Fedora. In addition I spoke to
2-3 people who were intrigued with contributing to Fedora in one way or
another. I’ll be following up with these individuals.&quot; This is a great
example of an event -- low cost, but high touch!

(L10n) Project.

Contributing Writer: Runa Bhattacharjee
== 14th October 2008 declared as the Package Translation deadline for
Fedora 10

The last date of submission of translations for Fedora 10 packages has
been announced as 14th October 2008 (Tuesday).[1] This announcement was
made after an unanimous decision by the Fedora L10n Steering Committee
(FLSCo) members. The last date for the translation of Documents remains
as 21st October 2008 (Tuesday).

A request for rebuilding of packages post the translation freeze date,
was also made to the Fedora-Devel-Announcement List.[2]

&quot;Maintainers of the above packages need to put a reminder to issue a new
build *later* than this date and before the Development Freeze of 21/10.
The closer to the development freeze the rebuild takes place, the better
for our translators. If you have not received any translations since the
last build, a rebuild is not necessary.&quot;

== Renewed call for volunteers for the L10n Infrastructure

Another call was made at the FLSCo meeting held on 16th September
2008[3] seeking volunteers for the Fedora L10n infrastructure.[4] The
earlier call was made in April 2008.[5]

Meanwhile, Asgeir Frimannsson announced a proposed plan for a new L10n
infrastructure which is currently being discussed in various relevant
mailing lists.[6][7]

== Planning a future L10N infrastructure (including Fedora)

Asgeir Frimannsson wrote on the @fedora-infrastructure-list [1] about
his views on the current localisation infrastructure. He summarises the
current infrastructure which is used by the localisation team, which
includes the version control system and other online tools. He also
discusses transifex. He also discusses the requirements for a system
where the translation lifecycle would be managed within 'Translation
Repositories'

== app2 disk space

Mike McGrath wrote on the @fedora-infrastructure-list[7] about the
recent disk alerts on app2. It seems that the host was not built with
enough disk space similar to app1. It does raise a point about storage
for transifex though. Basically each host running transifex or damned
lies, keeps a local copy of every scm as part of its usage. For
performance reasons that should not change but its something we'll want
to figure out long term. So after the freeze the host is going to be
rebuilt.

== Near to the Echo

Pursuing the declared goal of having the new Echo icon theme ready to be
used as a default in Fedora 10, Martin Sourada and Luya Tshimbalanga
continued the development and posting updates[1], [2], gathering
feed-back and improvement proposals on @fedora-art. Martin even created
an animated demo &quot;also prepared animated gif (slideshow) [3] so you can
see all the icons in one batch&quot; and blogged about it.

== Freedom for a game

Nicu Buculei relayed[1] to @fedora-art a request from the Hans deGoede,
of Games SIG fame: the Project: Starfighter game[2], which used to be
included in Fedora, was discovered of having some non-free graphic files
and need free replacements to be re-included. Erick Henrique offered[3]
his help &quot;I go to unpack the archive starfighter.pak and to study a form
of I redesign everything in a new style&quot; and Hans promised[4] to code a
needed utility &quot;About recreating the .pak file I need to write a little
utility for that, hopefully I'll have time for that this weekend.&quot;

== Infrastructure change for Fedora Art

After an IRC consultation with Mairin Duffy, Martin Sourada proposed[1]
using fedorahosted.org services for the Art team &quot;it might be worth
setting up a fedorahosted.org instance for the Fedora Art Team. Primary
purpose would be to host our release graphics, but it could serve other
purposes as well (e.g. using ticket system for design service come to my
mind)&quot;, an initiative received with open arms by Luya Tshimbalanga and
with some skepticism[3] by Ian Weller &quot;I'm personally all for the idea,
but I knew there were some caveats that we should definitely look into
before we even think about proceeding. I'd also like to see Mo's input,
of course.&quot; and Nicu Buculei[4] &quot;I am strongly against something which
would raise the barrier to entry, so a NO-NO would be to require git to
upload sketches (proposals) for the upcoming release.&quot;

==Virtualization==

In this section, we cover discussion on the @et-mgmnt-tools-list,
@fedora-xen-list, @libvirt-list and @ovirt-devel-list of Fedora
virtualization technologies.

Contributing Writer: Dale Bewley
== Enterprise Management Tools List

This section contains the discussion happening on the et-mgmt-tools list
== Virt-manager and Virtinst Closely Related

After upgrading virt-manager to 0.6.0, Maikel Dollé received[1] the
error ImportError: cannot import name Storage. Cole Robinson
explained[2] virt-manager is tied closely with virtinst and installing
virtinst 0.400.0 would likely fix the problem.

== Migration Support in Virt-manager GUI

Shigeki Sakamoto followed[1] up on a previous[2] request for comments on
a patch, submitted by same, which works to allow the migration of
domains from within the virt-manager GUI. Daniel P. Berrange
suggested[3] using a submenu rather than a pop-up window, and commented
on the sanity checks[4] in libvirt.

Live Migration Sanity Checks were recently discussed on @libvir list
(see FWN #141 Live Migration Sanity Checks[5]).

== Fedora Xen List

This section contains the discussion happening on the fedora-xen list.
== DomU Network Interface Problem Leads to Discussion of HVM Requirements

Guillaume[1] asked[1] about a paravirtualized domU which did not show
any network interfaces. There was a suggestion made that this could be
due to a lack of HVM support in the host hardware, which isn't the case.
Paul Wouters cleared[2] up such confusion by describing the main
virtualization techniques used in Fedora. Quoting:

    * Xen hypervisor for para_virt guests does not need HVM.

    Problem here is that Fedora 8 is the last release to support this
setup on x86_64, though work is in progress to add this support to
Fedora 9/10. Para_virt guests are booted via kernel= and rootfs images,
or via pygrub, which is just a wrapper for grabbing kernel from bootable
disk images.

    * Qemu is a software emulator for various architectures including PC
hardware.

    It requires no HVM instructions, but it can use them if they exist
via the kernel &quot;kvm&quot; code. This is how Fedora9 does its VM's via the
libvirt and virt-install. This does NOT [sic] use or require a xen
hypervisor.

    * Xenner is a software emulation for the Xen hypervisor.

    It requires HVM because it uses the kernel &quot;kvm&quot; code. The idea
behind Xenner is that you can run VM's based on kernel-xen kernels (eg
migration from Fedora8)

Paul went on to mention other[5] virtualization technologies such as
VirtualBox/Vmx, lguest, uml, virtuoso, and openvz.

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-xen/2008-September/msg00018.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-xen/2008-September/msg00018.html</a>

In another post[3] Paul suggested that Guillaume's domU may have an
initrd which lacks xenblk and xennet, and pointed[4] to a debate in the
FC6 era concerning the xenblk kernel module.

== Libvirt List

This section contains the discussion happening on the libvir-list.
== Minimal Client-only Libvirt Build

Ben Guthro patched[1] the libvirt spec file to allow for a minimal
client-only build.

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00264.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00264.html</a>
== Access to CPU Flags

Ben Guthro needed[1] to access CPU flags to determine if VMX features
were available, and suggested src/nodeinfo.c would be the place to parse
this. This however raised a concern that adding to the nodeinfo struct
breaks the API. Additionally, since this is an x86 specific change, Ben
wondered if it would be acceptable.

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00271.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00271.html</a>

Daniel P. Berrange stated[1] &quot;any struct or API in
include/libvirt/libvirt.h is immutable to preserve ABI&quot;, and the API
shouldn't be specifically x86. Daniel did offer that the most likely
place for exposing CPU flags would be in the capabilities[3] XML format.
Where PAE, VMX, and SVM flags are already exposed.

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00273.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00273.html</a>

[3] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt.html#virConnectGetCapabilities">http://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt.html#virConnectGetCapabilities</a>

Ben noted[4] that Xen will report those flags, but oVirt running KVM
does not, and said &quot;It seems to me that it might be useful for some sort
of &quot;node&quot; info driver, where we might be able to share code for
hypervisor independent info about the physical machine it is running
on.&quot; Daniel pointed[5] to src/nodeinfo.c as &quot;a place for this useful
reusable node info code&quot;.

== OpenVZ Support

Anton Protopopov pointed[1] to a previous thread[2] on xml format for
OpenVZ driver, and asked if libvirt supported the xml format for
OpenVZ[3] driver.

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00320.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00320.html</a>

[3] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://wiki.openvz.org">http://wiki.openvz.org</a>

Evgeniy Sokolov replied[4] that OpenVZ uses the XML format common for
all libvirt drivers.

<pre style="margin: 0em;">
One more Software Freedom Day well spent ;-)

</pre><tt>I'm proud to announce a new minor player in the world of insignificant 
</tt><tt>clones of major, important Free and Open Source Linux Distributions,
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

     *bling*  Orange Sombrero - /based on Fedora/ *bling*

</pre><tt>Orange Sombrero starts with releasing version number 9 - the same 
</tt><tt>version number as the upstream distribution, Fedora, to avoid confusion.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Has anything been changed?

</pre><tt>Yeah, a patch to anaconda[1,2] that didn't make it in in time for the 
</tt><tt>Fedora 10 Beta freeze has been applied to compose this release -which is 
</tt><tt>sort of the entire use case behind the patch anyway. Also, a different 
</tt><tt>branch of Revisor has been used that uses the patch to anaconda[3].
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Since I've got limited bandwidth and disk space, this is a 1 CD 
</tt><tt>distribution. If I had bandwidth and disk space, I might have thrown in 
</tt><tt>a mid-release Everything Spin but I couldn't. Also, given that this is a 
</tt><tt>1 CD distribution, I've added an install class to anaconda so that it 
</tt><tt>selects the correct groups of packages. Who needs &quot;Office &amp; 
</tt><tt>Productivity&quot; if there's only @core and @base, right? &quot;Base System&quot; FTW! 
</tt><tt>It was fun, it took me 4 koji scratch builds of anaconda and another 
</tt><tt>number of composes to get it &quot;right&quot;.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

</pre><tt>Note that despite these changes the installed system will behave just 
</tt><tt>the same as Fedora. In fact, if you look really hard, there's the 
</tt><tt>occasional &quot;Fedora&quot; in there, still -maybe that's because I used 
</tt><tt>fedora-release, which I should be able to do without trademark 
</tt><tt>violations, even though /etc/fedora-release still says &quot;Fedora&quot; ;-)
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Why bother?

</pre><tt>Trademark guidelines right now say a derivative distribution cannot use 
</tt><tt>&quot;based on Fedora&quot; -which is bad, and Orange Sombrero is now raising some 
</tt><tt>red flags about it. Work is well on it's way to improve that 
</tt><tt>situation[4] though, for which I thank everyone involved. I hope soon, 
</tt><tt>very soon, derivative's of Fedora pop up everywhere, like mushrooms in 
</tt><tt>autumn.
</tt><pre style="margin: 0em;">

Where is it?

<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://orangesombrero.org">http://orangesombrero.org</a> (torrents)

On behalf of the entire Orange Sombrero Community (e.g. ~1 person),

Kind regards,

<pre>Work on the Fedora infrastructure has returned to normal at this point.
Updates are once again available for Fedora 8 and Fedora 9, our current
releases, using the new package signing key we've implemented.  To read
more about the new package signing key, refer to:

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/New_signing_key">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/New_signing_key</a> 
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Enabling_new_signing_key">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Enabling_new_signing_key</a> 

In addition, Rawhide has returned to service, as well as our other
services such as Fedora Hosted.

As always, our team of system administrators makes incremental
improvements constantly.  Sometimes these improvements involve temporary
outages, and such outages may occur in the future as part of normal
operations.  At this time, however, we believe Fedora's recovery efforts
are complete.  To reiterate our previous statement, we have not found
any security vulnerabilities in any Fedora software as a result of our
efforts.

The security investigation into the intrusion is still in progress.
When that investigation is completed, the Fedora Project's intention is
to publish a more detailed report on the matter.

We will issue further updates as more information becomes available.

Fedora 8 and 9 Updates

Jesse Keating wrote more[0] about the status of updates on Fedora 8 and
Fedora 9. &quot;We're in the final stages of testing a few corner cases, and
preparing the official builds of fedora-release, PackageKit,
gnome-packagekit, and unique (needed as a new dep for gnome-packagekit).
All existing updates in the old update locations will be purged, and
just these updates will be put in their place, signed with our old key.
Once you've updated to these packages, the next update attempt will
point you to our new locations with our new keys and you should be able
to process any further pending updates. You'll be prompted to import the
new key along the way.&quot;

Additionally, &quot;these updates are designed to transition users from our
old repo locations to new locations that have all our updates re-signed
with a new set of keys[1].&quot;

I encourage everyone to read both announcements, and also to visit the
information page on the Fedora wiki[2].

Bodhi 0.5!

Luke Macken has been very active in Bodhi development lately[3].

&quot;One of the most noticable changes is that bodhi is much more
responsive. Previously, bodhi was a single python process, running on a
single server. This single server was also responsible for composing the
updates repositories, and rawhide, among lots of other bodhi-related
churn. This lead to much pain and suffering for all.

The bodhi deployment has since changed. All bodhi requests are now load
balanced to a bunch of app servers, each running mod_wsgi with multiple
bodhi processes, each with multiple threads. All of the hard work is now
done on an isolated releng server. This separate bodhi &quot;masher&quot; is now
responsible for composing repositories, updating bugs, generating update
notices, sending emails, extended metadata generation, and calculating
metrics. I also added support for inter-bodhi communication, which
allows our bodhi web frontends to kick off push requests to our
bodhi-masher instance.&quot;

Plenty more new-feature discussion in the full email.

Frozen for Fedora 10 Beta

Jesse Keating announced[4] that Rawhide is now frozen for Fedora 10
Beta. &quot;Rawhide will compose from the frozen content so that we all are
aware of what Beta is going to be comprised of. Extra scruitiny and
testing of rawhide over the next week is greatly appreciated.&quot;

In this section the people, personalities and debates on the
@fedora-devel mailing list are summarized.

External Repositories and the New Keys

As a result of the re-signing all the packages with a new key as a
security precaution[1] some problems with packages from third-party
repositories were reported[2] by Callum Lerwick. The specific example
was an update of the non-Free &quot;xine-lib-extras-nonfree&quot;. Seth Vidal
suggested[3] a simple fix of yum --skip-broken update.

Jef Spaleta experienced[4] no such error and speculated that it was due
to some mirrors being temporarily out of sync, which Matthew Woehlke
agreed[5] was likely. Kevin Kofler disagreed[6] and diagnosed the
problem as a &quot;chicken and egg&quot; one in which it was impossible to get the
new repository key which in turn would enable the new, matching xine-lib
to be obtained. He suggested that while it was possible to use yum
- --skip-broken or yum --exclude for a selective update it would be better
for new users to &quot;[...] use the PackageKit GUI, click on &quot;Review
updates&quot; and uncheck the xine-lib-extras-nonfree update, then apply.&quot;

Thorsten Leemhuis thought[7] that this was a general problem for the
livna repository in which they can only &quot;push [too] early or [too]
late&quot;. He had outlined the problem previously (see FWN#138 &quot;Solving the
Unsynchronized Release of Package Dependencies&quot;[8]) but his suggested
solution of adding a brief time period during which yum keeps checking
for missing dependencies had not obtained traction. Thorsten explained
again: &quot;[...] the problem happens each time when Livna/RPM Fusion
packages with deps on a specific Fedora packages get pushed in sync;
that creates a lot of trouble * I'd say once for 24 hours each two
weeks.&quot; He conceded[9] that yum --skip-broken was &quot;[...] best answer,
but that's not enabled by default in Fedora. Livna/RPM Fusion could fix
that via its releasepackages, but that's not nice and I want to avoid
going that route.&quot;

On the foot of a suggestion made[10] by Harald Hoyer to add &quot;More
Information button in PackageKit dialogs, which explains the situation
and that this might only just take some days to resolve[.]&quot; Richard
Hughes asked[11] for specific suggestions to improve the current
dialogs. He added that &quot;[m]y personal view is that by showing an error
dialog, we've lost, and should avoid doing it at all costs.&quot; Thorsten
responded[12] to Harald that he believed that it was best to &quot;[...]
enable skip-broken by default, but show the error to the user if
security updates are involved *or* if the problem doesn't vanish within
72 hours after it had been hit on the client for the first time&quot; and
that for the latter cases PackageKit could show some more information.

Non-X System Consoles to be Removed

ArthurPemberton was concerned[1] about the best way to help debug the
many [PulseAudio] issues which he was experiencing on Fedora 9. He asked
&quot;[w]hat information should I gather, how, and where should I present
it?&quot; This innocent enquiry spawned several sub-threads which avoided
answering his question.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00982.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00982.html</a>

In the first Bill Crawford recommended[2] disabling PulseAudio and
although Ignacio Vazquez-Abrams listed features unique to it Karel Zak
was[3] skeptical that &quot;ordinary&quot; users would need them. Toshio Kuratomi
responded[4] that the network transport features were very useful for
thinclients.

Janina Sajka chimed in[5] to agree with Arthur that while the idea of
PulseAudio was appealing and &quot;[...] holds great promise for
accessibility [...]&quot; there appeared to be practical problems to sort
out. Janina referenced SpeakupModified.org, which provides repositories
for a Fedora-derived distribution tailored towards users that rely on
audio cues instead of visual ones, and noted that it was currently
necessary to disable PulseAudio because &quot;[...] one gets no audio until
after a user logs in on the GUI. So, how are those who need screen
reader support supposed to use the a11y features of GDM? As it stands,
there seems no way to get console audio without that GUI login. Also a
nonstarter in the screen reader user community.&quot; She asked if anyone had
a &quot;working init script for pulseaudio as a system daemon?&quot; None of the
many message that followed appeared to have an answer to this question.
In part this appeared[6] to be because &lt; Orca can handle the audio
rendering of the GDM login screen. Colin provided[7] references that
should make it possible to configure GDM to work this way out of the box
using GConf settings. It seemed[8] that this was a possible solution.

At this point Colin Walters set off a firestorm of complaints and
queries when he announced[9], as an aside, that &quot;[w]e're going to be
removing the legacy non-X system consoles by default in the long run.&quot;

[9]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01180.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01180.html</a>

Jerry james listed[10] three scenarios in which he felt it would be very
useful to have text consoles. The advantages included faster startup
than with Xorg and independence from a damaged X session. Colin
rebutted[11] most of these with the argument that &quot;login is slow&quot; was a
bug which should be fixed and that the other scenarios also were
constructed on the basis of bugs which should be fixed (in the
applications themselves and in Xorg's ability to handle crashes.)

[10]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01186.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg01186.html</a>

Matthew Woehlke also wondered what would happen if Xorg itself was
broken and Colin asked[12] rhetorically &quot;What happens when the linux
kernel is broken? What happens when /bin/sh is broken? What happens when
NetworkManager is broken?&quot; He added that a compressed recovery image
should be included by default in a Fedora install. Matthew's response
suggested[13] that although it would be possible to recover it would
mean having to find a rescue disk and to reboot. He expressed a
preference for &quot;[having] X fail to start and dump me at a normal console
from which I can fix the problem *without rebooting*, much less needing
to dig up a rescue disk :P&quot; and compared the alternative to the
fragility of Windows. The issue then became a little clouded when Colin
stated &quot;I believe we already do that today, and am not advocating
removing that functionality if possible. Anyways, I've said what I need
to, so hopefully people won't be surprised later.&quot; Further
requests[14][15] for clarification on the previous statement produced no
simple response, although later Colin did appear to confirm[16] the
impression that he saw this as an essential change for the evolution of
Fedora as a Desktop.

make force-tag Gone

The removal of make force-tag was objected to[1] by Bastien Nocerra as
it forced bumping the Release of packages even for trivial changes. A
massive thread resulted with a good deal of agreement expressed with
Bastien.

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00675.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00675.html</a>

Mike McGrath made[2] the case that if maintainers tested packages before
committing them and adduced the necessity of the current workflow in
producing an audit trail for licensing as a concrete reason. Jon Ciesla
had earlier mentioned using TAG_OPTS=-F make tag as a work around and
now asked[3] if &quot;the Makefile can be modified to prevent it, so that
others who didn't know [that this invalidates the audit trail] stop
doing it?&quot; Doug Ledford responded[4] that this would be unenforceable as
it would still allow the CVS command to be run by hand and &quot;[i]f our
recent 'incident' showed us anything, it's that things like this need to
be enforced on the CVS server if they are going to be enforced at all.&quot;

Jesse Keating argued[5] that the issue was more GPL compliance than an
audit trail and outlined why he would personally prefer to move away
from building from CVS tags. Jef Spaleta suggested[6] that Mike McGrath
had misspoken: &quot;You are of course free to make 300 small separate
specfile changes between each build attempt. There is a desire to move
to a point where we can be reasonably sure that a cvs tag corresponds to
a specific build. Since we have no way of making only tags corresponding
to successfully built packages immutable, all tags must be immutable&quot;
and like Mike asked for a way to mark as immutable a subset of CVS tags
corresponding to a successful Koji build.

The thread is recommended reading for package maintainers and the brief
summary above misses many important points.
Graphics Modesetting Changes

A post by Dave Airlie reminded[1] the list that [KernelModesetting][2]
was going to be one of the notable features of Fedora 10 for recent
Radeon &quot;r300 to r500 (and possibly r600/r700)&quot; and Intel &quot;from i830 to
GM45 (though it may end up i915 and up only)&quot; GPUs . Adam Jackson
responded[3] to Bill Crawford that r200 class hardware would probably
not get modesetting in Fedora 10. Among other things this will have
cosmetic advantages such as removing flickers from the startup sequence,
reducing Xorg startup times and practical advantages such as oops/panic
messages while Xorg is running and improved suspend/resume support. Dave
cautioned that only a subset of the GPUs were working for the beta
release &quot;[...] r300 to r500 class of hardware, while we await upstream
changes to the Intel driver&quot; and noted that to disable modesetting one
should append nomodeset to the kernel command line via GRUB.

In response to Hans de Goede Dave welcomed[4] bug reports of the &quot;output
doesn't light up&quot; type and suggested using an ssh session to reboot to
runlevel 3 with nomodeset and then rmmod radeon drm; modprobe drm
debug=1; modprobe radeon modeset=1 and attach dmesg and an Xorg log to
the bugzilla entry. Following this recipe produced[5] no luck for
&quot;Joshua C.&quot; as everything froze once he followed the last step.

Skepticism about inserting the Intel driver code after the beta testing
period was expressed[6] by Jeremy Katz on the foot of such late changes
lacking both the visibility necessary for testing and the time to fix
any bugs revealed. Jeremy was mildly scathing: &quot;Yeah, I've seen intel's
'mature' code before. Excuse me if this is anything but reassuring.&quot;
Jesse Keating and Christopher Snook seemed[7] to accept Jeremy's point
and leaned towards the idea of implementing the KernelModesetting
contingency plan[8] of including the modesetting code disabled by
default, but allowing users to enable it on the kernel command line.

Adam Jackson wondered whether Jeremy was advocating removing all the new
code or testing it all and Jeremy suggested[9] the third option of only
enabling the radeon code for now and waiting for Fedora 11 to enable the
Intel code.

When &quot;Joshua C.&quot; asked[10] for a list of working radeon cards and
suggested applying the contingency plan because &quot;f10 is just a month
away&quot; he was corrected [11] by Paul Frields that it was approximately
two months away with a development freeze in six weeks. Dave asked[12]
Joshua to &quot;[...] stop scare mongering[,] it's a beta release, if it
still doesn't work at devel freeze I'll blacklist all the broken
machines&quot; which reaction surprised[13] Joshua a little.

Root Login Disallowed on GDM

Surprise was expressed[1] by &quot;Dr. Diesel&quot; when he attempted to log in as
root via GDM[2] to a rawhide install. &quot;Dr. Diesel&quot; reported that it was
possible to log in via the console in runlevel 3. He asked if he should
file a bugzilla entry.

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/">http://www.gnome.org/projects/gdm/</a>

Darrell Pfeifer quoted[3] the changelog as evidence that this
restriction was intentional to which &quot;Dr. Diesel&quot; responded that it
would be a good idea to change the prompt to &quot;[...] something like 'Root
login disabled'[.]&quot;. Matthew Woehlke was disturbed and wondered &quot;[...]
what exactly are we supposed to do when the user login gets hosed? Reach
for a rescue disk? (Seriously, what's with the sudden trend to make
fixing problems harder by making recovery modes inaccessible in an
apparent bid to hide the &quot;confusing/potentially dangerous&quot; bits of the
system from the user?)&quot; The latter part of this apparently being a
reference to another recent thread (see this FWN#143 &quot;Non-X System
Consoles to be Removed&quot;.)

Benjamin Lewis presented[4] a straightforward, obvious way of fixing
such problems: &quot;CTRL+ALT+F1, login as root, fix it, CTRL+ALT+F7 to get
back to GDM&quot; and Martin Sourada added &quot;[or] boot to runlevel 3, login as
root there and startx...&quot;

The discussion was moved on[5] by Nigel Jones with a suggestion that the
default setup should configure sudo to allow the first user configured
during firstboot to have &quot;full access w/ password.&quot; Steven Moix
disagreed[6] as this all seemed like the &quot;Ubuntu 'protect us from
ourselves' way&quot; which removed the conscious choice to log in as root.
Martin Sourada was also filled[7] with dismay at the idea, but his
objection was that PolicyKit was a superior solution to sudo. This
preference was confronted[8] by Thorsten Leemhuis with a request to
&quot;[...] please tell me how for example read /var/log/messages or other
log files from /var/log/ using PolicyKit from a -gnome,kde-terminal with
an easy to remember and fast to type command (like 'sudo') [.]&quot; Thorsten
also suggested that firstboot could present a checkbox labeled &quot;User is
the sysadmin for this system&quot; that when checked would configure sudo
and/or PolicyKit or any other desiderata for allowing root privileges
for the user. Matthew Miller largely agreed with this and suggested that
&quot;uncommenting the wheel group in /etc/sudoers, and having said checkbox
add the user to the wheel group&quot; would be the way to do it, but Seth
Vidal raised[9] the problem of &quot;[...] the wheel group, on systems which
are using some other form of nss than local files, can be mucked with
too easily.&quot;

All this was strangely reminiscent of previous discussions, e.g. FWN#103
&quot;Root Login And Display Managers In Rawhide&quot;[10] except that PolicyKit
now offers some possible new directions as Martin Sourada outlined[11:]
&quot;What I am mostly against is having full access to sudo without password
by default by any user. I believe PolicyKit is designed to solve this
issue by granting rights (by admin) to user to do this and that and not
do other admin tasks [...] the implementation should IMHO be like
cat/nano/vi/whatever detects that you are trying to access some file you
don't have enough rights to access, then it asks PolicyKit whether to
allow it or not and PolicyKit handles the rest (i.e. checks whether your
admin already allowed that access for you, if not asks for root password
for allowing the access and if succeeded sends back that its OK for you
to access the file). Ideally it wouldn't require any additional command
(like sudo) [...] When I want to view logs (though I don't very much
understand why I cannot read them as normal user) I just log in as root
(in console/gnome-terminal only!). Yeah it's not pleasant to write root
password every time I want to do some admin task - and that's probably
one of the reasons why PolicyKit has been developed - but I think
allowing full access to sudo without password for normal user account is
a big security hole.&quot;

Missing Screen Locking Spurs Inquiry Into User-state Maintenance

When John Ellson enquired[1] why &quot;[...] my userid, and only my userid,
has no Lock Screen menu item or applet?&quot; a brief thread revealed the
many places in which user state is kept. The answer, for the impatient,
turned out[2] to be that John had experimented with Pessulus[3], which
allows administrators to enforce mandatory GConf settings on users.

.gnome .gnome2 .gconf .gconfd .metacity and this failed to restore the
default. Chris Snook suggested[4] that he consider /tmp&lt;/cod&gt; as another
location where &quot;per-user state is kept&quot; but John had investigated[5]
both &lt;code&gt;/tmp and /var/tmp.

Jesse Keating wondered[6] if &quot;[...] it's not a ConsoleKit interaction
making the session think your user isn't at the console?&quot; John replied
that he had gone to the extraordinary lengths of &quot;moving aside my home
directory, deleting my userid, removing everything in /tmp and /var/tmp,
rebooting creating a new userid with the same name (but different user
and group numbers), and it still has no Lock Screen!!!&quot; Jef Spaleta
made[7] the disclaimer that he did not &quot;[...] understand
PolicyKit/ConsoleKit well enough to help you track it down in the
filesystem with 100% confidence[...]&quot; but suggested searching in
/var/lib/PolicyKit and /var/lib/PolicyKit-public for per-user
authorization rules. This was reported[8] as fruitless by John, as was
running polkit-auth. John wondered where the output of polkit-auth came
from as &quot;Removing /var/lib/PolicyKit/user-ellson.auths doesn't change
the output.&quot;

MatthiasClasen cut straight to the chase and suggested[9] a good,
old-fashioned backtrace &quot;Why don't we stop all this blind guessing, and
attach a debugger to the panel instead ? It would be so much easier...&quot;
Although John wondered[10] why gnome-panel sprang to Matthias' mind as a
culprit a later suggestion[11] to &quot;[...] break in
panel_lock_screen_action_available [...]&quot; gave him a clue as to the problem.

Pessulus has been around since Fedora 7 at least and the process above
was a bit of a wild goose chase, but what is interesting is how
difficult it is to solve such a problem due to the many places in which
such information is stored.

Removal of old projects from fedorahosted.

susmit shannigrahi writes for fedora-infrastructure-list [2]

Susmit reminded the list that, Fedora has a policy to remove _any_
hosted projects that are not altered or updated for last six months. And
provided a list of projects, which falls into this category and they
will soon be removed.

How to Select a &quot;Winning&quot; Theme

MairinDuffy opened[1] a debate on @fedora-art about the best way to
select the final theme in a release: &quot;We have not yet had a case where
more than one theme met this basic requirement. In case we do have
multiple themes that meet this requirement, we need a fair method to
choose which theme is selected as the default&quot; and going further, she
proposed a solution and asked for opinions: &quot;My suggestion is that we
have a vote within the set of active Fedora art team contributors. The
problem is how do we determine who is allowed in this vote - who is
active? &quot;

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-art-list/2008-September/msg00095.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-art-list/2008-September/msg00095.html</a>

SamueleStorari opted[2] for a wide vote in the community &quot;I think the
vote will be totally open to the whole community.&quot; arguing that &quot;the
graphic it's made for all, think about art, think about expression, it
comes from the inside need of someone to express to other, to
comunicate.&quot;, an opinion endorsed by MariaLeandro[3] and IanWeller who
proposed[4] an alternate and complex system &quot;Or, perhaps even better,
take a two-part voting approach; 50% of the vote allocated to current
Art Team members (recent contributions, 6 months, yada yada) and 50% for
the community.&quot;

On the other hand, NicuBuculei opposed[5] the community vote invoking
the notion of competence &quot;the trouble is that the large community knows
little about usability and good design&quot;, an opinion similar to that
expressed[6] by MatthiasClasen &quot;Taste is not something that can be
decided with simple majority. Voting for the default theme would pretty
much devolve into 'which is the coolest looking background when glancing
at a bunch of screenshots', which is not at all what a good default
theme is about. This forum is the place for qualified and interested
people to work on the art that makes up the default theme. It should
also be the place where the default theme gets put together.&quot;

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-art-list/2008-September/msg00101.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-art-list/2008-September/msg00101.html</a>

Another argument against a community-wide vote was raised[7] by
MairinDuffy &quot;we don't really have time to plan for a Fedora-wide vote,
and since there's not much time to wait on people to vote and to get the
word out, we won't have a good representation of our base in the vote
results.&quot;

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-art-list/2008-September/msg00106.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-art-list/2008-September/msg00106.html</a>

- From his position as a Fedora Board member, JeffSpaleta came to the
conclusion &quot;I consider the multiple rounds of discussion over the themes
as a prolonged 'community' decision. The final artwork decision is a
culminating event in a process. Are people encouraged to participate in
the earlier stages of that process as part of the art team? if they
choose not to participate in the previous rounds do they have the
context to make informed decisions at the final stage? Have they earned
the right to be a part of the final decision? I'm not sure they do.&quot;

As a solution to get the themes as soon as possible into the hands of
the users and receive early feedback MairinDuffy issued a last-minute
call[9] for packaging the current proposals into Fedora 10 Beta &quot;if we
could get a package put together with the wallpapers that are in the
running so far it could make the Beta.&quot; The call answered quickly by
MartinSourada [10], who created the packages.The packages were reviewed
and are already available in Rawhide.

Fedora Xen List

This section contains the discussion happening on the fedora-xen list.
Laying the Groundwork for Xen Domain 0 Support

There are further developments in the state of Xen in upstream Linux
(see FWN#137[3]). Pasi Kärkkäinen forwarded[1] a patch announcement[2]
from xen-devel list. This set of seven patches begin to lay the
groundwork for Xen domain 0 support.

Daniel P. Berrange said[4] these patches will make their way into
rawhide when they are merged into the LKML[5] dev tree line used by
rawhide at that time.

Libvirt List

This section contains the discussion happening on the libvir-list.
Libvirt 0.4.5 Released

Daniel Veillard announced[1] the release of libvirt 0.4.5. In addition
to a long changelog, the &quot;main features are the improvement of OpenVZ
and LXC, the uniform XML handling (and hence format) th[r]ough all
drivers, improvements in devices handling for QEmu/KVM and storage pool
source discovery.&quot;

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00186.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2008-September/msg00186.html</a>
Segfault if no Qemu Emulator Passed

Cole Robinson patched[1] a bug that resulted in a segfault if a Qemu
domain is defined without an emulator value. Daniel Berrange
expressed[2] displeasure at letting this bug slip through and proposed a
&quot;brown paper bag&quot; release. Daniel Veillard advised[3] against rushing
the fix, and offered to push the patch to Fedora's build while other
distributions could pick up the fix in a week or two when libvirt 0.4.6
would presumably be released.

Daniel Berrange pointed out code test coverage reports[4] on the build
server, and highlighted the need to create a functional test rig for the
mass of code that is simply not possible to unit test due to
interactions with host OS state / functionality.

Ability to Nice KVM Processes

Henri Cook expressed[1] a desire to nice KVM processes, and proposed a
means to pass arbitrary command string parameters to the process startup.

As mentioned[2] in FWN #141, Daniel Berrange pointed out[3] the goal of
libvirt is consistent API representation across hypervisors. Fortunately
there is a 'schedular parameters' API in libvirt. All that's needed is
for someone to implement the schedular parameters driver API for KVM.

RFC Thoughts on Open Source Hypervisor Management

Nathan Charles described[1] his ideal clustered VM provisioning system.
Features would include

    * cluster administration is done from the command line
    * cluster administration can be performed from any node
    * a new node can join a cluster on a local subnet with one command
    * local storage resources are presented to the cluster so there is
no need to have predefined NAS/SAN/iSCSI
    * cluster will load balance vm instances from node to node
    * a node shouldn't need more than one nic but adding additional
nic's provides failover and load balancing

Nathan acknowledged oVirt's virtues, but stated it requires a lot of
substantial changes and significant modification to work with an
existing provisioning infrastructure. Nathan requested comments on his
thoughts.

The only reply[2] so far came from Stefan de Konink, who pointed to some
code[3] which seems[4] to be a &quot;handler for libvirt using avahiclient&quot;.

oVirt Devel List

This section contains the discussion happening on the ovirt-devel list.
oVirt Source Repository Refactored

Perry N. Myers announced[1] the completion of the restructuring of the
oVirt source mentioned in FWN #142[2]. This reorganization resulted in
commits of numerous spec files and other changes making an RPM-based
install more feasible.

oVirt Migration Status

Atsushi SAKAI asked[1] if the following assumptions were true. KVM
supports migration, while Qemu does not. Ovirt release supports
migration, developer version does not. Chris Lalancette clarified[2]
&quot;there is live migration code in upstream kvm userspace, but not in
upstream qemu&quot; and fully emulated guests can be live migrated as long as
the KVM binary is used to do it (which ovirt does).

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00107.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00107.html</a>

Atsushi inquired of the fake managed nodes, and Chris Lalancette
explained[3] the fake managed nodes are abstractions to allow
experimenting oVirt with limited hardware. Perry N. Myers added[4] there
is work underway to remove the 'fake node' concept.

[3] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00110.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00110.html</a>

Network Interface Bonding and Failover Work Continues

Darryl L. Pierce continued[1] work on NIC bonding and failover (see FWN
#142[2]) laying out the process a node will use to configure interfaces
on bootup and the selection of bonding type which must be selected on
the server. Types include

    * Load Balancing
    * Failover
    * Broadcast
    * Link Aggregation

[1] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00243.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/ovirt-devel/2008-September/msg00243.html</a>

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FWN/Issue142#Network_Interface_Bonding_and_Failover">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FWN/Issue142#Network_Interface_Bonding_and_Failover</a>

Daniel P. Berrange inquired[3] if those four options was a limit of the
bonding driver or a design choice, since more complex bonding
configurations are plausible. Darryl L. Pierce affirmed[4] it is a
design choice to keep things simple initially. Chris Lalancette
pointed[5] out there are many combinations of bridges, bonds, and VLANs,
and &quot;we have to figure out which combinations are completely insane,
which are valid and make sense, and then make sure we can handle those.&quot;

Related discussion occurred in another[6] thread on how to configure
multiple bondings for a host in the UI.

<pre>In a few hours, updates for Fedora 8 and Fedora 9 will start hitting
mirrors.  These updates are designed to transition users from our old
repo locations to new locations that have all our updates re-signed with
a new set of keys.  

Most users will simply need to apply the offered updates, and later
apply any further updates, and verify/import the new GPG key.

The process to getting new updates is two stage.

Stage 1) Users configured to get updates from existing repos will see a
small set of updates available in the next few hours/days.  These
updates include fedora-release, PackageKit, gnome-packagekit, and unique
(for Fedora 8, only fedora-release is offered).  These updates should be
applied as soon as possible.

Stage 2) Once the above updates have been applied, your update tools
(yum, PackageKit, pirut) will see a new repository and a larger set of
updates available.  This is your new standard flow of updates, that will
continue to see new updates as the lifetime of Fedora 8 and 9 progress.

There will be further milestones in the future that involve redirection
of release package repos to match that of updates, and removing of old
gpg key from rpm trust.

Time for another update on the F8 and F9 updates status.

Our testing with the live update content as gone well.  We identified a
couple issues with the current PackageKit and thanks to Richard Hughes
we'll have an updated PackageKit to offer as well as an updated
fedora-release package for our users.  The combination of the two (or
just the fedora-release package for you non-packagekit users) will be
all that you will need in order to gain access to our newly signed and
relocated updates.

We're in the final stages of testing a few corner cases, and preparing
the official builds of fedora-release, PackageKit, gnome-packagekit, and
unique (needed as a new dep for gnome-packagekit).  All existing updates
in the old update locations will be purged, and just these updates will
be put in their place, signed with our old key.  Once you've updated to
these packages, the next update attempt will point you to our new
locations with our new keys and you should be able to process any
further pending updates.  You'll be prompted to import the new key along
the way.

A wiki page has been created that covers some of this,
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Enabling_new_signing_key">https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Enabling_new_signing_key</a> and will be
updated throughout the day as we finish the above listed tasks.  A more
formal announcement along with links to the official FAQ will be
published to same lists this mail is going out to, and likely picked up
by various news sites.  We expect things to wrap up by the end of today
or early tomorrow.

Once again we thank you for your continued patience and be aware that
we're nearly there!

Jesse Keating discussed[2] the Fedora 10 Beta schedule. &quot;The new freeze
date is Sept. 9, which is in 7 days. This is a friendly reminder that
the freeze is coming up, and coming up quickly. I realize that rawhide
has been less than great lately, and we're working quite hard to fix the
issues.&quot;

Fedora 8 and 9 Updates Status

Jesse Keating wrote[3] about the status of updates on Fedora 8 and
Fedora 9. &quot;We have done a successful compose of all the existing and as
of yesterday pending updates for Fedora 8 and Fedora 9, all signed with
our new keys. These updates will soon hit mirrors in a new set of
directory locations. What we don't have quite yet is the updated
fedora-release package in the old updates location that will get you the
new keys and the new repo locations. The last mile testing of this
update requires that new updates be live on the mirrors.&quot;

FESCo Issue Tracking

Kevin Fenzi announced[4] the new FESCo issue-tracking tool. &quot;In the
past, interested parties could bring matters to the attention of FESCo
in several ways: Mailing the chair, following up to the schedule posting
on the devel list asking for a new topic to be added, or attending
meetings on irc and bringing up the topic at the end of the meeting in
the Open Discussion phase.

While these methods work well for issues that simply need a bit of
discussion and a decision, longer term issues that should be tracked and
discussed further sometimes are forgotten.&quot;

John Poelstra wrote[0] about the revised Fedora 10 schedule, which as
been moved to account for the infrastructure problems that we faced a
few weeks ago. &quot;Last week the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee
(FESCo) ratified the updated schedule proposed by the Release
Engineering team. This resulted in feature freeze for Fedora moving to
2008-09-09 and GA to 2008-11-18. This three week change to the schedule
was to accommodate the recent infrastructure outages.&quot;

Another Fedora Test Day is in the books, and James Laska wrote[1] about
it on his blog. &quot;There was a really strong developer turn out for this
Test Day. In addition to David Huff, the appliance-tools developer, some
of the oVirt team showed up to help walk through oVirt's use of
appliance-tools. This was tremendously helpful to see how
appliance-tools can be used by other projects. Thanks to Alan Pevec,
Bryan Kearney and Darryl Pierce from the oVirt team for joining the
event. Having such a tight feedback loop with the developers during Test
Days has been very helpful, I hope we can continue with that format.&quot;

=Artwork=

Nicu Buculei posted[2] the latest iterations of some of the potential
Fedora 10 artwork themes. &quot;The second round in the process of creating a
visual theme for Fedora 10 ended yesterday, those are the proposals
meeting the requirement and which will pass into the third (last) round
(listed in chronological order).&quot;

Your beat writer is particularly fond of the Gears/Steampunk theme as
well as the Solar theme, but thinks that all four are fantastic pieces
of art, and should be carried over into Fedora 11's proposals.

Tech Tidbits

Yaakov Nemoy reported[3] on the state of Haskell in Fedora. &quot;After
nearly 9 months, I am finally at the point I wanted to be regarding
Haskell. Last January i wanted to submit packages for my favourite
window manager to Fedora. I got blocked because of a lack of packaging
guidelines and familiarity with Haskell or the Glasgow Haskell Compiler.&quot;

Continuing his habit of posting yum-related tutorials, James Antill
posted[4] a quick explanation of packages sizes in yum and rpm.

&quot;It's pretty common to think that a specific thing always has a specific
size, and people tend to think of an &quot;rpm package&quot; as a single object
thus. the it's common to ask what is &quot;the size of an rpm&quot;. However if
you have a 1MB text file, and gzip compresses it to 50KB which you then
upload to a HTTP server you now have at least 3 different sizes: text
size; compressed size and upload size (includes HTTP headers etc.) and
asking for the size. So it is with rpm packages, and their many sizes.&quot;

Getting Back on our Feet

On 05-09-2008 Jesse Keating posted[1] the good news that &quot;[...] we have
done a successful compose of all the existing[,] and as of yesterday[,]
pending updates for Fedora 8 and Fedora 9, all signed with our new
keys.&quot; He cautioned that the size of this backlog of updates meant that
it would take some time to get them out to mirrors. The updates will be
in new directory locations and there will be an &quot;[...] updated
fedora-release package in the old updates location that will get you the
new keys and the new repo locations.&quot;

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00329.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00329.html</a>

Jesse was keen to point out that there would be a FAQ to which we can
all contribute and that its location will be announced shortly.

Sean Darcy, after thanking Jesse for all the work he had put in,
asked[2] how he could get the new key for updates right now without
having to wait for the fedora-release package to be placed in the old
repository location. A variety of answers followed and the canonical one
appeared[3] to be that given by Todd Zullinger in which he suggested
obtaining fedora-release from CVS and then checking that the
fingerprints matched those published[4] on the FedoraProject website.
Some minor confusion followed[5] as the example presented on the web
page uses the old key signed by &quot;fedora redhat com&quot; but the new key is
signed by &quot;fedora fedoraproject org&quot;. Similarly the use of &quot;PUBKEY&quot; as a
placeholder variable on the web page caused some difficulties which Todd
cleared[6] up again.

Jeffrey Ollie made[7] the good point that using a GPG WoT would make it
easier for Fedorans to have confidence that they had obtained the
correct key and hoped that those at the Brno FUDCon could &quot;arrange an
impromptu keysigning[.]&quot;

Early in the week on 02-09-2008 Stefan Grosse asked[8] politely when the
resigned Fedora 9 updates would be available. Bruno Wolff III
suggested[9] &quot;If you are worried about something in particular, you can
look at bodhi to see pending updates and updates-testing and get rpms
from koji if there is something you want right now.&quot; A brief discussion
between Till Maas, Jesse Keating and Bruno Wolff explored whether it was
possible to download from Koji using SSL if one did not have a FAS
account. Bruno testified[10] &quot;I needed certs (two from fedora and mine)
to get the bodhi client to work. I used this to grab a list of stable
updates last week [...] I didn't bother with ssl when grabbing them from
koji.&quot; Till was[11] using wget to grab the packages from Koji and found
it necessary to use certificates. Jesse showed[12] that it was possible
to do a koji download-build to get packages anonymously.

In a separate thread Jesse Keating announced[13] that the revised Fedora
10 freeze date would be 09-09-2008 and as part of a friendly reminder
that it was coming up quickly observed &quot;I realize that rawhide has been
less than great lately, and we're working quite hard to fix the issues.
The installer images from the 30th may be of use in getting rawhide
installed and then updating to what is in the public repos. See

(please only grab the installer images from there, not the entire
tree).&quot; Matt Miller reported[14] a successful net install from the
Fedora 10 alpha images using the rawhide repository.

Removing Packages with Long-standing FTBFS Failures

Matt Domsch posted[1] a list of ninety packages which &quot;Fail To Build
- From Source&quot; (FTBFS)[2]. Matt noted that some of these packages have
failed since 02-2008 and that &quot;[...] packages with unresolved FTBFS bugs
immediately following the Alpha release will be removed from the
distribution&quot; in line with a proposal passed by FESCo. He asked that
concerned parties help to resolve the problems and noted that several of
them had easy fixes.

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00319.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00319.html</a>

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FTBFS">http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FTBFS</a>

Response was fairly quick and positive from both those listed as
maintainers and concerned parties that needed the packages in Fedora 10.

One interesting ramification of the removal of such packages was
mentioned[3] by Daniel Berrange who asserted &quot;[t]his list is far from
complete - if you want to remove these 90, the dependency chain ripple,
will entail the removal of tonnes of other packages which depend on
these.&quot; He asked Matt to generate a report which &quot;[...] shows the ripple
effect for each proposed package. If something is just a leaf-node, it
isn't very important to worry about, but if something triggers removal
of 50 dependant packages that's pretty damn important to fix. This info
would be useful in prioritizing which builds need fixing most urgently.&quot;
SethVidal modified[4] a script written by James Antill so that it did
exactly that and Matt posted[5] a link to the script and an example run.
Till Maas suggested[6] that it would be useful make sure that a src.rpm
responsible for several dependent packages is only counted once.

The practical consequence of neglecting such dependencies was
highlighted[7] by Matthias Clasen when he commented that
&quot;djvulibre-devel is a BuildRequires for evince. If you remove djvulibre,
evince will become unbuildable.&quot; Jesse Keating responded that Daniel, or
his team should fix the package as &quot;[i]f we have to do a chained rebuild
for various reasons, evince would fail due to this package not building
first.&quot;

The inclusion of monodevelop in the list had the side effect of spurring
the Mono maintainers including Michel Salim, David Nielsen and Paul
Johnson to decide[8] to attempt a co-ordinated push of &quot;Mono-2.0&quot;.

MinGW on Fedora

The availability of a MinGW development repository was announced[1] by
Richard Jones. &quot;MinGW&quot; provides a GNU toolchain on Windows allowing the
development of Free native Windows binaries. Richard credited Daniel
Berrange with a good deal of the work.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00296.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00296.html</a>

In response to Farkas Levente's question, as to when it would be
available in Fedora, Daniel replied[2] that due to the need for
&quot;infrastructure&quot; to create a separate repository and dedicated build
root it was impossible to predict. Jef Spaleta seemed[3] to be trying to
move the process forward and published a draft which explained that
&quot;[t]he initial impetus for this effort has been ovirt developers who
desire to more easily use Fedora installations as development
environments for the work they are doing to build open source
cross-platform virtualization tools.&quot; The possible impact on
FedoraProject resources appears to have led to the compromise of
creating a separate repository which could be strictly confined in size.

Richard Jones encouraged[4] Farkas to try out MinGW without waiting for
official inclusion in Fedora &quot;[...] if you want to download and play
with it, and send patches :-) It's currently buildable on Rawhide, and
possibly on earlier versions of Fedora too.&quot; Farkas then revealed that
he currently used an older MinGW on RHEL5 and Richard responded[5] that
although there were no srpms at this moment it should be possible to use
the specfiles and patches (both in the mercurial repository[6]) to
rebuild everything.

Dependency Loops Considered Harmful?

[[MiroslavLichvar|Miroslav Lichvar] raised[1] the issue of a
considerable number of packages (354 by his count) which are components
of dependency loops in the rawhide repository. Miroslav provided[2] a
list. In such loops two or more RPM packages require each other as
dependencies in their spec files with the result that it can become
confusing for users trying to remove selected packages manually with yum
or rpm. Miroslav wondered whether such loops were acceptable and
specifically &quot;why games data depend on binaries?&quot;

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00149.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00149.html</a>

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://fedorapeople.org/~mlichvar/tmp/rawhide.i386.loops">http://fedorapeople.org/~mlichvar/tmp/rawhide.i386.loops</a>

A substantial conversation resulted which exposed the different needs of
packagers and users, some possible limitations due to the design of rpm
and varied philosophies concerning the correct way to specify
dependencies. One of the central examples chosen were the game packages
which tend to be split into a &quot;binary&quot; or &quot;engine&quot; package and a
companion &quot;data&quot; package for graphics, sound and levels. The central
concerns expressed were that occasionally an install followed by a
remove will leave &quot;orphaned&quot; packages behind. Also in contention was the
specific case of developers experiencing the problem of maintaining a
stable environment when there is no easy way of tracking changes to
system libraries. The package manager aptitude was mentioned favorably
due to its ability to distinguish between packages installed
automatically to satisfy dependencies and those which are installed
manually.

On the one hand Chris Snook and Michael Schwendt advocated[3] that
instead of using Requires: foo &gt;= X in their spec files packagers should
choose Conflicts: foo &lt; X . The possible downside to this would be
installing game data yet having no game engine/binary installed. This
was seen as a non-serious problem.

[3]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00211.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00211.html</a>

On the other hand Jon Ciesla argued[4] that the advantage of having
games data depend on their binaries from a packagers perspective is that
it ensures that attempting to upgrade the binary Version without also
upgrading the data will fail. The case of allowing minor fixes without
forcing users to download a big bundle of data can be handled by bumping
the Release of the package. More concisely he answered[5] that the
reason for the dependencies was that &quot;[...] so when you remove the game,
you remove the data.&quot; Michael responded[6] that Jon's example could be
handled by using a Requires: foo-data = X without exposing the increased
risk of needing to &quot;bump'n'rebuld&quot; the data package each time the engine
package incremented its Version while still working with the same data.
He characterized such dependencies as &quot;superfluous [...] try[ing] to
enhance 'yum remove'.&quot;

[4]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00150.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-September/msg00150.html</a>

This was not accepted as accurate by Jon and he described the current
situation as &quot;require on name and version&quot; for game data which allows
Release to be changed without affecting the match on Name and Version
&quot;If new data is required, it will change the version. If not, we only
increment the binary rpm's release, so the data rpm matches on version
and needs no rebuild.&quot; Michael responded[7] by laying out two cases, the
first of which illustrated the problem of having to update the data
package solely to keep in step with updates to the version so that yum
remove would function properly. His alternate case used non-versioned
dependencies in the data package and strict dependencies in the engine
package. Hans de Goede seemed a bit irritated and asked Michael to
&quot;Please take an actual look at game spec files before making up all
kinds of BS, it's really easy&quot; and argued that for games there was a
one-to-one mapping between the engine and the data. He added that just
because other cases resulted in dependencies being sucked in by an
install and left behind on a remove there was no reason to change the
way things were done for games.

Stephen Gallagher suggested that the &quot;groups&quot; exposed through yum should
be used to bundle together the multiple packages for an application
instead of using looped dependencies to which Callum Lerwick replied[8]
that it was actually time to &quot;implement the per-package 'explicitly
installed/pulled in as a dep' flag that has been discussed several times
in the past, and is already implemented (thus proven) in the 'aptitude'
apt front end.&quot; He followed this with an amusing piece of hyperbole
about &quot;the looming dark future of closed DRM-laden content delivery
services[.]&quot;

Toshio Kuratomi raised[9] the problem faced by developers using system
libraries that could come and go due to packages being updated or
removed. Callum's suggestion was[10] that developers should be &quot;RPM
packag[ing] your app. Apps on your system that are not tracked by RPM
are a ticking time bomb of dependency breakage whether or not the 'leaf
culling' is performed manually or is assisted by a 'pulled in as dep'
flag. A package or distribution update could very well break your app
too.&quot; Needless to say Toshio had[11] several objections to this
including the impact on developer workflow imposed by packaging up
everything and the inadvisability of forcing developers to become expert
administrators. He suggested that &quot;If we implement this, it needs to be
at a low enough level that anyone installing packages on the system will
be storing the information. That could mean rpm (since rpm is
responsible for taking the package and turning it into files on the
filesystem) or that could mean yum since yum is the one that actually
knows whether a package is being installed due to depsolving or user
request. Doing this at a higher level means that information gets lost
(for instance, if you do this in PackageKit, there won't be any
information about what anaconda chose to install due to checkboxes being
clicked and which things were installed due to dependencies). With that
said, there needs to be a way for a developer to tell yum not to prune
away leaf packages if they want.&quot; A very detailed and amusing discussion
with (among others) Matthew Woehlke followed in which Matthew argued[12]
for a script which essentially produced a parallel iuserj rpm database
so that quick and dirty rpms could be produced locally for developers.

Jef Spaleta wondered[13] what actual examples revealed about the amount
of harddrive space being consumed by dependencies and remarked &quot;I hope
the packagekit people are watching this discussion. The game data
subpackaging issue should be right up their ally in terms of end-user
ease of use issues.&quot; He discounted the polluting of the packagelist but
MichaelSchwendt pointed out[14] that as the packagelist increases then
&quot;[because of] the frequent updates common in Fedora land, you need to
download and update more[.]&quot;

The idea of keeping game data outside of any package management was
mentioned[15] by James Antill as an &quot;obvious fix&quot; and he discounted the
probability of PackageKit being able to do anything about the issue if
yum or rpm could not. Jef responded[16] that &quot;[a]t some point someone is
going to have to wade into rpm itself for ease of use of removals to get
better&quot; and pointed out that he was &quot;[...] making sure that the people
with the right motivation and the right skills find the right way to
handle it. That's not going to happen just by telling the current
maintainers who are abusing the available requires syntax that they are
abusing the syntax and slapping their wrists.&quot; Richard Hughes showed[17]
that the PackageKit developers were indeed listening to the conversation
and mentioned that he had considered &quot;[...] running through a large
&quot;get-depends&quot; output into the basename filter, so that the user only
sees the 'applications' by default, rather than a huge list[.]&quot;

There is a lot more to this conversation than reported here, but the
main thrust is that the limitations of rpm have resulted in package
maintainers wrangling spec files to do what they want which in some
cases has undesirable effects.
Fedora Security Tools Spin

A suggestion was made[1] by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala to produce a Security
Tools spin similar to the &quot;Knoppix Security Tools Distribution&quot;[2] .

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://knoppix-std.org/index.html">http://knoppix-std.org/index.html</a>

Todd Zullinger responded[3] that there was already a spin similar to
this being curated by Luke Macken. The SecuritySpin[4] mentioned by Luke
seemed to be roughly what Huzaifa was searching for, except that he
thought it should have &quot;more tools and [be] more bare bones&quot;.

Adrian Pilchowiec mentioned[5] a free fork of nessus named OpenVAS[6] as
a desirable part of the spin. Luke drew[7] attention to the need for
more people to help out with packaging missing tools. Subsequently the
wishlist of the project recorded that Huzaifa was packaging up OpenVAS
and labrea.

archives on secondary1

Matt Domsch writes for fedora-infrastructure-list [2]

Matt asked if archives.fp.o is on secondary1.fp.o There are 2 separate
rsyncd.conf files in puppet, one for archives,one for secondary. Given
they land at the same place on the same machine, only the one for
secondary is actually in effect. If they're going to be on the same
machine, we need to merge them. On this Mike replied with an affirmative
saying that they need to be merged.

Working on a Sound Theme

ChrisNorman uploaded[1] a first preview of a new desktop sound theme
created for Fedora and he received[2] some feedback about length and
content from NicuBuculei: &quot;I am not sure about speaking the English word
'attention' - some people not speaking English may not be that happy.
And maybe, just maybe, a few sounds, like 'window-close.wav' are a bit
too long&quot;.

Echo Icon Theme as a Fedora 10 Feature

LuyaTshimbalanga reported[1] about FESCO acceptance of the new Echo icon
set as a default in Fedora 10: &quot;Fesco has accepted echo-icon-theme as
default icon theme for Fedora 10.[1] Which means we need to push harder
to include as many icons as possible using guideline and echo-artist
tool now available on rawhide and is waiting for people to get them on
both Fedora 8 and 9&quot;

MatthiasClasen outlined[2] the importance of having Echo as a default in
the upcoming beta release &quot;I think we need to act quickly to make Echo
the default for the beta, to test the waters before F10&quot; and soon after
that he operated the change[3].

MartinSourada noted that the feature depends on the icon coverage &quot;Just
a note that Fesco (and many art team members as well) has some concerns
about coverage. Simply said if we don't achieve the Mist/gnome icon
themes coverage, we'll be rolled back to Mist and wait for another
release&quot; and offered to mentor new contributors.

Use Avahi to Discover Local Servers in Virt-manager

Cole Robinson committed[1] a patch[2] to add support for avahi polling
in the virt-manager 'Open Connection' dialog.

Virtio Support in Libvirt and Virt-manager

Emre Erenoglu asked[1] if virtio[2] would be supported in virt-manager.
Daniel P. Berrange said[3] libvirt supports it as of 0.4.4 and
virt-manager will soon automatically enable virtio for disks known to
include it.

The design paradigm[4] for virt-manager is to allow selection of OS Type
and Variant which informs the features to be enabled, rather than
exposing individual features toggles. Cole Robinson agreed[5] exposing
the option to enable virtio disks for an unknow virtio-enabled
distribution might not be a bad idea.

Nothing to report this week.
Libvirt List

This section contains the discussion happening on the libvir-list.
Libvirt vs XenAPI

Atif Bajwa asked[1] about the advantages of using libvirt over XenAPI
and what platforms libvirt supports. Atsushi Sakai pointed to a list[2]
of which libvirt calls work on which drivers / hypervisors. Daniel P.
Berrange replied[3] that libvirt is available for every major Linux
distro, and listed several benefits such as:

    * avoids locking applications to a particular hypervisor
    * provides a guaranteed stable API that can be used both locally and
remotely
    * remote security options include SSL + x509 certificates, SSH
tunnel, Kerberos GSSAPI single sign on, and username + password
    * works with every version of Xen 3.0.x or later while XenAPI is
only usable in Xen 3.1.0 and later

Richard W.M. Jones mentioned[4] that although there are no binaries yet,
libvirt client code can be compiled on windows.

Does Libvirtd Need to Always be Running

Yushu Yao asked[1] a basic question which may be helpful to point out.
Does libvirtd need to always be running? Richard W.M. Jones answered[2]
&quot;yes and no&quot;. The local Xen hypervisor can be managed by direct
hypervisor calls and/or a connection to xend. Warnings that libvirtd
isn't running may be ignored.

Libvirtd must be running to support the following, however.

    * remote access
    * non-root access
    * if you use the network or storage features
    * managing QEMU and KVM instances

oVirt Devel List

This section contains the discussion happening on the ovirt-devel list.
Renaming oVirt RPMs

Alan Pevec proposed[1] renaming the oVirt packages which turned into a
discussion with Daniel P. Berrange about how to organize the git repos
and how to continue support build-all after such a change.

WUI Management of Underlying Hardware

Chris Lalancette posted[1] a series of patches to allow the Web User
Interface to manage the underlying hardware it is running on.

Network Interface Bonding and Failover

Darryl L. Pierce began[1] a discussion on implementing support for
ethernet bonding multiple interfaces for load balancing and failover.
Special consideration for different hardware scenarios such as blade
servers lead Konrad Rzeszutek to ask how these extra parameters would be
passed in to the bonding setup. Darryl explained[2] that on boot the
node identifies itself to the oVirt server, and downloads a
configuration file to be processed by augtool[3]. The managed node then
restarts the network service to apply the network configuration that it
just retrieved.

<pre>﻿The Board is holding its monthly public meeting on Tuesday, 9 September
2008, at 1800 UTC on IRC Freenode.  The public is invited to do the
following:

* Join #fedora-board-meeting to see the Board's conversation.  This
channel is read-only for non-Board members.
* Join #fedora-board-public to discuss topics and post questions.  This
channel is read/write for everyone.

The moderator will direct questions from the #fedora-board-public
channel to the Board members at #fedora-board-meeting.  This should limit
confusion and ensure our logs are useful to everyone.

﻿The Board has set aside one meeting of each month as a public &quot;town
hall&quot; style meeting.  We are *still* hoping to hold an audio-based
meeting at some point in the near future using some of the new resources
being developed by the Infrastructure team.  More news on this will be
forthcoming.  We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>posted by Kevin Fenzi &lt;kevin scrye com&gt;</p>
<pre>Greetings. 

In the past, interested parties could bring matters to the attention of
FESCo in several ways: Mailing the chair, following up to the schedule
posting on the devel list asking for a new topic to be added, or
attending meetings on irc and bringing up the topic at the end of the
meeting in the Open Discussion phase. 

While these methods work well for issues that simply need a bit of
discussion and a decision, longer term issues that should be tracked
and discussed further sometimes are forgotten. 

To help solve this issue, and to make it easier for folks to bring an
issue before FESCo, I have asked Fedora Infrastructure to setup a trac
instance for FESCo to track tasks and handle new issues. 

New issues for FESCo can now be filed at: 

<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://fedorahosted.org/fesco/">https://fedorahosted.org/fesco/</a>

Please feel free to file issues there. 

Note that FESCo (Fedora Engineering Steering Committee) handles the
process of accepting new features, the acceptance of new packaging
sponsors, Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and SIG Oversight, the
packaging process, handling and enforcement of maintainer issues and
other technical matters related to the distribution and its construction

Thanks.

<pre>As you well know, we have been working hard to get updates for 8 and 9
flowing again, complete with new package signing keys.  Discussion has
been somewhat quiet on this front as we've all had our heads down and
have been working hard toward a solution, one that involves little to no
manual effort on behalf of our users.

Today we've reached a major milestone in this progress.  We have done a
successful compose of all the existing and as of yesterday pending
updates for Fedora 8 and Fedora 9, all signed with our new keys.  These
updates will soon hit mirrors in a new set of directory locations.  What
we don't have quite yet is the updated fedora-release package in the old
updates location that will get you the new keys and the new repo
locations.  The last mile testing of this update requires that new
updates be live on the mirrors.

Due to the size of the resigned updates, it may take a good while for
our sync process.  This may delay getting the new fedora-release out
until tomorrow, but we'll be working hard on it.

While we're working on this update, we'll also be drafting a FAQ page to
explain to users what it is that we're doing, and hopefully answer some
of the questions that will come up.  This document will be living
though, and as you encounter questions yourself, or questions via one of
our many avenues of support (email, IRC, forums, LUGS, etc..) please
help us in growing that document.  Announcements regarding the location
of said document and how to help with content will be coming shortly.

We deeply appreciate the enormous magnitude of patience you the greater
community has shown us the Fedora project as we work though these
serious issues.  It is a great testament to how wonderful it is to work
in and with the Fedora community.

Education

The Fedora Education Spin is progressing[0], having been &quot;approved by
all necessary bodies - Spin SIG, Board, Rel-Eng&quot;, reported Sebastian
Dziallas. The spin has its own feature page. &quot;Hopefully, we'll be able
to have a preview of the spin ready in the next weeks&quot;, added Sebastian.

Greg DeKoenigsberg reminded potential OLPC contributors[1] to surf over
to the contributors' program on the OLPC wiki in order to request their
own XO for development. Soon, Greg &quot;will be sitting in on the weekly
call that decides how these laptops are disbursed&quot;.

Tech Tidbits

Michael DeHaan, holder of the coveted &quot;best blogger on Planet Fedora&quot;
title, as determined each week by your correspondent, has penned a
treatise[8] concerning the future of systems management software.
&quot;Cobbler and Func are very fun, I think they are quite useful, but I'm
wondering what are next on the horizon for server management tech, not
in terms of a evolutionary improvement but how things can be
legitimately improved by fundamental, indeed 'paradigm-shifty' means.&quot;

James Antill has written[9] a tutorial on the Python yum API, which is
incredibly useful if you have ever wanted to do stuff with yum, but
don't know where to start and are afraid to ask Seth.

Events

David Nalley shared some details about the upcoming Fedora Ambassadors
Day for North America[2]. The event will coincide with Ohio Linux Fest
in October. David said, &quot;If you are a Fedora Ambassador, or want to be
one, you should try and attend.&quot;

[2] <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nalley.sc/david/?p=81">http://www.nalley.sc/david/?p=81</a>

[[ChristophWickert|Christoph Wickert] attended FrOSCon 2008, along with
several other other Ambassadors, and shared his event report[3]. &quot;Just
like on Linuxtag the Fedora booth was located close to the entrance, so
we had quite a lot of visitors. Unfortunately the booth was a little
small and we had lot of stuff to show: Two OLPCs, an eeepc, two ALIX
Machines and a couple of Laptops. Everything was running Fedora, the
Laptops were running Gnome and Xfce, mine also LXDE.&quot; Check out the link
below for pictures, and the full report.

Max Spevack reminded[4] everyone about the upcoming FUDCon Brno. &quot;We
currently have 110 people registered for the event,&quot; and the list of
sessions and hackfests is on the Fedora wiki. Hans de Goede will be
attending FUDCon Brno. He wrote an update[5] about webcam support in
Fedora, which will be worked on at FUDCon, and also blogged[6] about the
session he will give on how to become a Fedora package maintainer.

Fedora List

Fedora Board member Chris Tyler wrote[7] about the plans for changing
the scope and ownership of fedora-list. Chris says, it is &quot;one of the
first lists that most Fedora users join, and therefore quite important
to the community. However, it's a high-volume list (and is sometimes
perceived to have a high noise level), so many veterans of the Fedora
community aren't subscribed... Paul Frields and I have taken on the
ownership of the list, and we'd welcome one or two experienced members
of the community to join us.&quot;

Approaches to a Minimal Fedora

Luya Tshimbalanga alerted[1] the list to a post on FedoraForum.org in
which a user &quot;stevea&quot; had produced a 67MB &quot;minimalFedora&quot; system. Jeff
Spaleta worried[2] that the bare-bones system was unable to receive
updates and that this was something which &quot;we as a project might not
officially want to endorse.&quot; One way out of that suggested by Jef was
that interested parties could produce a derived distribution which
pushed out entire updated images. Recent changes in the trademark
guidelines make such a move easier.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01304.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01304.html</a>

A parallel to the minimal OS appliance image used in the oVirt project
was discerned[3] by Daniel Berrange. Daniel reported their 'oVirt
managed node' as being less than 64MB and built entirely from the Fedora
9 repositories. Later Daniel posted[4] that the similarities ended with
the desire for a small image. The oVirt goal was to use only Fedora as
upstream whereas stevea's approach had been to substitute coreutils with
busybox. Daniel acknowledged &quot;[...] finding the bits which aren't needed
is fun in itself &amp; somewhat of a moving target. So wherever possible
we've been filing BZ to get some RPMs split up into finer grained
sub-RPMs&quot; and included a link to his project's kickstart %post stanza.
Richard Jones suggested[5] that KDE's filelight was useful for finding
bloated files and Vasile Gaburici added[6] that there was a GNOME
equivalent called baobab. Vasile also included[7] a script which he uses
to &quot;keep track of bloatware&quot;.

A follow-up post from Daniel concluded[8] that the only bits of upstream
Fedora actually used in stevea's approach were the kernel and busybox as
even glibc and initscripts had been ditched. Daniel wondered &quot;So not
really much trace of Fedora left at all. Not sure why you'd go to the
trouble of doing the initial anaconda install at that point - might as
well just 'rpm *no-deps' install kernel + busybox RPMs into a chroot &amp;
add the custom init script.&quot;

Doubt on the advantages of stripping down Fedora to make it run on
embedded targets was cast[9] by Patrice Kadionik when he argued that
using the Fedora kernel with all its patches and modules was too
bloated. Instead he preferred to use the vanilla kernel with busybox
with the result that &quot;[...] you have a Linux kernel (about 1MB) with its
root [filesystem] (about 1-2 MB) adapted completely to the target
platform.&quot; Alan Cox replied[10] that the ability to receive updates and
benefit from the maintained and tested code was desirable if there were
enough extra space.

W. Michael Petullo added a link[11] to his &quot;FedoraNano&quot; project which
has the goal of reducing redundancies, identifying probable cases for
sub-packaging and documenting a method to install a small Fedora onto
solid state drives.

Using PackageKit Without NetworkManager-Controlled Interfaces

A question from Martin Langhoff asked[1]: &quot;[i]s there anything
preventing PK from connecting to the network over
non-[NetworkManager]-controlled network interfaces?&quot; This question
appeared to be predicated on the assumption that PackageKit had a
dependency on NetworkManager.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01209.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01209.html</a>

Jeremy Katz clarified[2] that PackageKit depended on NetworkManager-glib
and not on NetworkManager. He added that this was because PackageKit
attempted to determine the status of the network connection prior to
checking for updates. Dan Williams confirmed[3] that this was the case
and expanded on the explanation: &quot;If talking to NM fails, the app should
either (a) assume a connection, or (b) could be more intelligent by
asking SIOCGIFCONF/netlink for interfaces, and if at least one interface
is IFF_UP | IFF_RUNNING and has an IP address, then try.&quot; Using
NetworkManager in this way allows PackageKit to be restricted to
sensible choices about the type of networks over which it is acceptable
to receive updates.

[2]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01210.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01210.html</a>

[3]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01213.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01213.html</a>

A further point raised by Martin was that there were a surprising number
of dependencies and Dan pointed[4] to bugzilla entry#351101[5] while
noting that &quot;[PackageKit] should only depend on NetworkManager-glib,
which itself should not pull in NetworkManager in the future.&quot; That bug
specifically affects multilib systems, that is x86-64 systems with i386
packages on them, and prevents the simple removal of the older version
of NetworkManager-glib and replacement with a re-factored one. This will
be fixed for Fedora 10 using the installer anaconda.

[4]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01214.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-August/msg01214.html</a>

[5] <a  rel="nofollow" href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show.bug.cgi?id=351101">https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show.bug.cgi?id=351101</a>

In a separate thread Martin asked[6] what debugging facilities were
available for network scripts beyond using bash -x. He detailed his
&quot;hack du jour&quot; by which /etc/udev/rules.d/60-net.rules invokes
net.hotplug.debugger which in turn uses bash -x net.hotplug with STDIN
and STDOUT redirected to a logfile. It appeared from the lack of further
suggestions that this is a good strategy. He also provided[7] a note
which explained that he was upgrading the &quot;School Server&quot; spin to Fedora
9 from Fedora 7.

Git-1.6.0 Commands to be Moved Out of PATH

A response by Todd Zullinger to a &quot;cvsextras&quot; commit[1] of changes to
git questioned[2] whether setting gitexecdir=%{_bindir} was a justified
deviation from upstream intent. According to Todd &quot;[..] we've
effectively negated upstream's intent to present less binaries in the
users path&quot;. Currently there are 137 git-commands in the /usr/bin
directory. Todd suggested that it was better that individual users added
the output of $(git *exec-path) to their PATH environment variable. As a
precaution against breaking scripts upon update to git-1.6.0 Todd
suggested that this addition to PATH should be made by the package.

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-extras-commits/2008-August/msg05593.html">http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-extras-commits/2008-August/msg05593.html</a>

The package maintainer responsible for the change, James Bowes
replied[3] that he had recently attempted to do as Todd suggested and
that had resulted in complaints. He was worried that although Todd's
change made sense there had been no due diligence conducted to see what
would break if the git-* commands were moved in such a way. Josh Boyer
replied[4] that the original complaint had been about &quot;yank[ing] out
commands [...] from a stable release [Fedora 9]&quot;. Todd Zullinger
discounted such complaints and dreamt[5] that &quot;[...] a warning could be
hand delivered by a beautiful naked person of whatever gender the user
prefers and many would still scream when the change finally landed. :)&quot;
He suggested that in order to achieve predictability and consistency
across distributions it was best to follow upstream and use the update
to 1.6.0 as a flag day.

In response to queries as to whether there was a need to update Fedora 9
also Josh Boyer replied[6] that a security bug was fixed by git-1.6.0
but that he thought that this might have also been fixed by &quot;a later
release of 1.5.6.x.&quot;

Resurrecting Multi-Key Signatures in RPM

Spurred on by the disquiet caused by the recent signing of Red Hat
packages (but not as far as is known any Fedora packages)[1] it was
suggested[2] by Bojan Smojver that multiple GPG signatures of RPM
packages would be a good idea. Distributing the signing could include
using alternate buildsystems &quot;[...] with no public access [...] to
verify package checks before signing[.]&quot;

[1]
<a  rel="nofollow" href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-August/msg00012.html">https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-August/msg00012.html</a>

Andrew Bartlett thought that the checksum part would be a problem
because a build often includes hosts, build times and other specifics
and Chris Adams added[3] that even individual files within a package had
such information embedded. Bojan decided to find out how many packages
were so constrained and Seth Vidal suggested[4] a useful rpm command rpm
- -qp *dump pkg.rpm to list all available information about each package.

Seth was dubious about the general idea and upon being pressed doubted
the security gain and noted the cost incurred on users trying to verify
that a package was signed correctly. Bojan expanded[5] upon the idea
that for a &quot;[...] multi-key, multi-build system, an attacker would need
to get his hands on a lot of private key passwords, break multiple
independent build systems [...] It is similar to what a reporter does to
confirm a story. One source, not so reliable. Two sources, more
reliable. Many sources, most likely reliable.&quot; Stephen Smoogen
described[6] this a logical fallacy and argued that due to the number of
packages all signing would need to be automated and thus probably each
of the multiple sources would &quot;[...] get their information from the same
top level source.&quot;

A useful post by Nils Philippsen laid out[7] four practical objections.
Prime among these was that there were additional pieces of data, besides
those mentioned above, embedded in a specific build even though the
source package may have the same tag. The possibility of making the
build system vulnerable to a DoS attack was also mentioned. A sub-thread
on German banking practices and the value of multiple credentials
developed[8] as did one[9] on the problems of determinism in producing
identical binaries.

Tom Lane was also among those that expressed[10] a general skepticism
that the increased burden of such a scheme was realistic: &quot;Most of us
[packagers] are overworked already. We aren't going to jump through any
hoops for third-party signatories.&quot; Bojan argued[11] that if the system
were automated then it probably would be vulnerable but suggested that
it would be better if a community effort to absorb the extra
non-automatic work would be a solution in line with &quot;open source&quot;
practices. Reluctantly he concluded &quot;[n]ever mind, it was just an idea.
Probably not even a good one. Back to the drawing board... ;-)&quot;

Intrusion Recovery Slow and Steady

A politely phrased request[1] was made on 25-08-2008 by Mike Chambers
for information about when normal service would resume in the Fedora
Project after the disruptions[1a]. Enigmatically Dominik 'Rathann'
Mierzejewski observed[2] that there had been &quot;some speculation on
fedora-advisory-board that might explain the information blackout, so
please don't jump to conclusions until you really know what happened&quot;
This led Chris Adams to observe that the list archives appeared to be
offline and to restate the request for information &quot;[...] in the absence
of information, rumors and speculation fill the gap (which is not good).&quot;

Several days later (on 28-08-2008) a similar request was made[3] by Alan
Dunn. He wondered whether bodhi was pushing updates out again, and Josh
Boyer responded[4] that planning and implementation of &quot;how to revoke
the current gpg key used to sign RPMs&quot; were in progress. Jesse Keating
cautioned[5] that the migration to a new key would be slow &quot;I'm
currently re-signing all of the 8 and 9 content with these new keys so
that we can make them available along with the new updates with the new
key for these product lines. This is going to take some time due to the
nature of how our signing works.&quot;

A proposal mooted[6] on @rel-eng by Warren Togami and others provided
some insight into at least the part of the plans that involve the
problem of how to distribute a new package signing key.

&quot;nodata&quot; asked[7] whether the new plans included a means to push out
critical security updates even while there was a general outage. The
thinking behind this seems to be that an attacker could decide to knock
out Fedora infrastructure in order to gain some time to exploit a known
vulnerability even if a simple fix existed. Jesse Keating replied[8]
confidently that in such a scenario the Fedora Project would do
&quot;whatever it takes [...] to get a critical update onto a public
webserver should the need arise&quot; and cautioned against wasting time
trying to plan for every possible scenario. Toshio Kuratomi added[9]
that although it might be possible to speed up recovery &quot;[...]
unfortunately if the infrastructure problem is bad enough, there's no
way we can push package X out until the problem is at least partially
resolved.&quot;

On 27-08-2008 Paul Johnson noted that it was possible to &quot;compose and
build&quot; and asked &quot;when will updates via yum become available for
rawhide?&quot; Jeremy Katz responded[10] that &quot;[a]t the moment, the compose
is falling over for new reasons unrelated to the infrastructure changes.
Hopefully we'll see a rawhide make its way out to the masses real soon now.&quot;

Some noteworty praise

Paul W. Frields writes for fedora-infrastructure-list [1]

Paul forwarded a mail [2] send by Tim Burke, who is the Director of
Linux Development inside Red Hat, praising the efforts of fedorans who
rose to the occasion to bring things back on track after the recent
incidents in Fedora infrastructure.

Maintaining a partial cvs workarea

Axel Thimm writes for fedora-infrastructure-list [3]

Axel described how he was keeping a partial check-out of packages, ie
the ones which he was maintaining. Now he would like to be able to cvs
up and have all updates flow in, but if he does do so cvs will want to
get all other thousand packages in. He is currently using a for loop
with pushd/popd, but this process is extremely slow. Axel asked if there
was a better way of doing this?

rawhide, /mnt/koji and /pub/fedora

Jesse Keating writes for fedora-infrastructure-list [4]

Jesse created a user &quot;masher&quot; to have the ability to write to
/mnt/koji/mash/ but not any of the other koji space. This is useful to
prevent too much damage from a horribly wrong rawhide compose. To make
things easier in the rawhide compose configs, they decided to run the
cron/scripts as the masher user. This is also good because it means
things run unprivileged. However he ran into a snag. They have another
user, 'ftpsync' that has write access to /pub/fedora/. Previously the
rawhide script was ran as root, and thus it was no problem to su ftpsync
for the rsync calls. The masher user does not possess the capability of
doing this.

The Echo icon theme and Fedora 10

NicuBuculei asked[1] on @fedora-art about the plans to use the new Echo
icon set as a default on Fedora 10: &quot;considering the feature freeze, the
Beta release and as Echo is not a feature proposed for F10, is correct
the assumption that we won't have Echo as a default for F10, staying
with Mist [at least] one more release cycle?&quot;

In reply LuyaTshimbalanga pointed[2] out that it is still possible, due
to a slip in the release cycle: &quot;Shall we try to make it as Fedora 10
feature. Thanks to, in some extend, the incident, feature freeze has
been moved on September 9th.&quot;

MartinSourada shared[3] his experience &quot;It seems like artwork things are
preferred to be decided by the Art Team rather than Fesco. I have a
feeling it might be same for Echo.&quot; and proposed that this decision
should be made together by the Art and Desktop teams &quot;In this case I
personally think Echo should be put on evaluation by Art Team and
Desktop Team. If both agree it's ready for default we can roll it in
;-)&quot; while NicuBuculei stressed[4] the importance of having Art features
listed &quot;from a marketing POV, if we list it as a &quot;feature&quot; it will be
picked by more news source and help building the excitement around the
new release.&quot;

Automating the One Canvas workflow

In the last FWN[1] issue we covered 'One Canvas workflow', an innovative
way to create icons, this week it continued to be a topic on @fedora-art
and MartinSourada introduced[2][3] a script that makes the work easier.
&quot;[It] greatly simplifies life for Echo artist, since all they need is to
make the Source SVG, run the script on it, select which branches they'd
like to push it to and write commit message(s) - i.e. it automates most
of the process&quot;. He also wrote a blog post[4] about this and created a
screencast[5] illustrating the process.

Nguyen Anh Quynh asked[1] how libvirt can expose the unique features of
a given hypervisor such as the monitor interface of Qemu. Daniel P.
Berrange responded[2] by stating the policy for adding new APIs to
libvirt is that the conceptual representation has to be applicable to
multiple hypervisors and unique concepts may be exposed if they can be
represented in a way which would also make sense for other hypervisors
in the future. This goal is also stated in the libvirt architecture
document.
